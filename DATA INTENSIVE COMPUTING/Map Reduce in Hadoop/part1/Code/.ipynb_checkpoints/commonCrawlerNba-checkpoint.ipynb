So leagu union agre sever modif exist rule tri give team abil retain core player poached. the previou cba singl “design player exception” team use one player rooki scale contract. that player could get five-year max deal extens team hit final year rooki deal -- essence, give new six-year deal team. the idea team would better opportun keep young core player could tie max dollar hit free agenc -- and, indeed, sever team took advantag rule -- oklahoma citi (russel westbrook), houston (jame harden), clipper (blake griffin), chicago (derrick rose), indiana (paul george), cleveland (kyri irving) washington (john wall). those player elig get max player less seven years’ experi final year rooki contract -- 25 percent cap. but could also earn 30 percent cap new deal reach certain criteria rooki deals: name first, second third all-nba team twice, vote starter all-star team twice win nba most valuabl player award once. (that’ dpe better known “derrick rose rule,” then-bul guard mvp award 2011.) the new cba four design player except -- two player still rooki deals, two new one veterans. they work before: team give four player roster new six-year contract -- five-year max extens ad final year exist deals. the idea give incumb team still chanc keep core group together. the veteran dpe use either give player extens re-sign free agent. player draft current team elig extens team use dpe re-sign free agents. the criteria veteran dpe similar player rooki deal -- player leagu mvp (or, veterans’ case, defens player year) made one three all-nba team previou season, all-nba/dpoy two previou three seasons, leagu mvp previou three seasons. the new rule would, example, allow oklahoma citi offer westbrook new six-year max contract next juli would keep potenti becom free agent follow 2017-18 season.

By contrast, westbrook opt deal explor unrestrict free agenc 2018, could get four-year deal anoth team. It would still humung amount coin -- $162.5 million. but last year incumb team offer (and, keep mind, new deal, incumb team offer annual eight percent raises; non-incumb offer five percent raises) becom stagger amount money walk away. but player turn max offer like that, least team pretti good idea much earlier process go lose him, allow team plan ahead certainty. that shouldn’t issu team like warriors, even though convent wisdom posit money system make harder “superteams” stay intact. As mani point out, example, warrior may problem bring whole roster back give stephen curri kevin durant separ max deal next summer -- $200 million curry, golden state bird rights, qualifi veteran dpe, allow 35 percent team’ cap -- $36 million next year durant, bird rights. the warrior would thu clear cap room give durant max. the warrior littl $37 million commit 2017-18 alreadi five players, includ klay thompson ($17.8 million) draymond green ($16.4 million). If 2017-18 cap remain current project $103 million, golden state need $36 million cap room durant -- unless agre smaller deal warrior earli bird free agent -- mandatori cap hold fill rest roster would hamstr warriors’ abil sign free agents, includ 2015 final mvp andr iguodala veteran guard shaun livingston. \\n    chri paul, new benefit packag retir player \\n   but mid-level except also increasingli significantli new rules, elit team like warrior weapon lure veteran player may will take short-term financi haircut play contender. those except avail rebuild team like heat well. but cap room import team like miami, hope enough room next summer abl add two max players. but cap expert albert nahmad point last week, heat could face difficulti execut quick rebuild.

In opinion, reason lebron' last mvp trophi 2013. We see thing year year year (and even get better 15th season), time noth special us take granted. I want hear opinion left out. are alreadi fed impress westbrook accomplish second time saw last year? Or way it? (hi point averag lower last year reach mileston end season without time creat narr case mvp candidacy) it’ fair question, konstantin.  I think tend take peopl grant they’v maintain state excel long lebron has. and I don’t think there’ question it’ probabl cost anoth mvp two voter (and I includ this) gravit new thing. one could certainli cast mvp vote lebron year without hesitation. It would hard cleveland cavali struggl mightili mani stretch season, especi defens end, lebron part struggle.  In westbrook’ case, I think it’ combin things. first, everi season drumbeat, voter thought last season doesn’t matter year. and that’ why, thunder’ record year basic last year, circumst okc’ season total different. last year, okc come devast loss kevin durant, leav thunder westbrook without top-fiv player play of.  that westbrook led team playoffs, put number did, remark context. yes, victor oladipo domanta sabonis, retrospect, better show there, never would gotten opportun indiana. mayb coach billi donovan could done incorpor them. it’ fair criticism.  second, it’ facil dismiss westbrook’ triple-doubl accomplish say he’ hunt stats. name superstar doesn’t, hasn’t, hasn’t assist time time sympathet home stat crews. the bottom line one averag triple-doubl sinc oscar robertson 1962. westbrook done two year row.

It seem like luke walton pick lakers, part, learn steve kerr. rick carlisl assist chuck daly, PJ carlesimo larri bird got first head coach gig. kenni atkinson work d'antoni get hire nets. and on. so, pick coach nba team, factor would look at? great question. To me, biggest thing nba head coach credibility. how credibl take differ forms.  A former player bring certain gravita locker room, sure. for example, kevin garnett ever decid want coach, I think he’d chanc good it; player respect immensely. other coach gain credibl work ethic and/or grind, like erik spoelstra stevens. obviously, comfort belief analytics, today’ nba, must well. even you’r winning, show player want someth comfort modern number mean -- think brett brown -- surviv bad year two. the late dali said well mani year ago: nba team like 12 differ fortun 500 companies. they must allow coach them.
