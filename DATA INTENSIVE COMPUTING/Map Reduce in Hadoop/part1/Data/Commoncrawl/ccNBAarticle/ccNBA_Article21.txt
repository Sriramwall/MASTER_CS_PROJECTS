            jame harden fifth leagu score (30.0 ppg) first assist (13.0 apg).
           can jame harden hasn’t happen leagu 40 years? and, enough get rocket back true titl contention? the rocket got harden oklahoma citi 2012. A year later, ad dwight howard free agency. A year later, came within eyelash ad chri bosh free agency, too. A year later, western confer finals. A year later, they’d fire coach kevin mchale lost howard free agency, relationship harden deterior beyond repair. houston back squar one, harden. but wors squar behind. through nine game -- seven road -- harden spectacular. he’ fifth leagu score (30.0 point per game), lead leagu assist (13.0 apg). for good measure, he’ lead houston rebound (8.0 rpg). the player nba histori lead leagu categori season kansa citi kings’ tini archibald, averag 34 point 11.4 assist 1972-73. nor rash ball -- current per 31.3 fourth leagu behind chri paul (32), anthoni davi demar derozan (each 31.5). after drop kia mvp radar last season -- he’d finish second stephen curri 2014-15 -- harden’ back discussion, fulli empow new coach mike d’antoni ball make decis it. offici name harden point guard season began mere depth chart issue. He alreadi rockets’ point guard. and there’ longer need make sure howard get enough touches.  there’ lot space, harden said last week, a lot opportun get basket, find guys. previously, littl bit crowded. you’v got respect shooters. you’v got abl find know times, you’r go pay it. GM daryl morey went knew believ summer, spend $133 million free agent ryan anderson ($80 million four years) eric gordon ($53 million four), $15 million bring d’antoni’ space- three-friendli offense. onc howard went atlanta, replac anderson gordon, idea harden oper rock space immens intriguing.  that start daryl front office, d’antoni said. they know it. they’v alway play way. they robert horri sit (a stretch four); they’v philosophi long time works. ryan one best shooter get, got lucki got him. and eric, also, good long distanc shooter; even shoot longer I thought. He heck job. We got lucki that. now, we’v got blend defense. that’ problem. per nba.com/stats, houston current seventh leagu offens rate (107.6 point per 100 possessions) tie ninth score (107 per game). the rocket second warrior effect field goal percentag (.542) true shoot percentag (.576). and houston sixth nba assist ratio (18), number assist per 100 possessions. the ball moving. but end floor still mess. houston 27th leagu defens rating, allow 107.8 point per 100 possessions, 20th point allow per game (106.7). and that’ rocket play fast; aren’t. they’r 17th leagu pace (99.2 possess per 48 minutes). that respons season houston fall assist coach jeff bzdelik, former nugget coach learn pat riley miami return nba 2014 memphi colleg coach stint colorado wake forest. bzdelik, though, somewhat limit -- personnel houston, calendar. onc season start day full-blown practices; starter need rest game night next day, one complet healthy.  defens done everi day, bzdelik said, either film, walk through, active, live drills. there pieces. houston’ best shot improv meh defens number last season come pat beverley, one league’ best on-bal irritants, return arthroscop knee surgeri week so. that also allow d’antoni return gordon sixth man role lengthen bench. small forward trevor ariza still provid textbook one-man weaksid defense, still stay front guy much often not. with pogo stick-ish clint capela take howard center, nene provid low-post brute forc reserve, rocket keep paint clean nights. but rest defens doesn’t hold up. the rocket 20th opponents’ made three per game. there also, simply, limit current personnel. harden’ bad defens youtub click would believe, he’ stopper nearli consist enough effort (understand acceptable, given burden produc one way almost everi time offens end). anderson okay rebound career limit stage career chase stretch four like, well, himself. corey brewer long doesn’t caus much havoc rocket would like. without beverley floor (he bring someth don’t right -- dog defens point guard mentality, harden said) isn’t anybodi get anyone’ skin.  we’r working, nene said. we good players, good effort, we’v got maintain focu consistent. we’r good things. offensively, we’r go fine, defensively, we’v got consistent. and without fouling. howard often foul troubl (not alway fault, often jump last second tri cover teammat who’d broken dribble), capela still young susceptible.  the whole team improv that, bzdelik said, understand rule use rule advantage. play hand arm back, verticality, proper posit earli you’r late. nineti percent foul defens mistakes. ariza say bzdelik emphasizing, belichick-ian fashion, everyon job. everybodi string, everybodi one another, help one another, ariza said. ’caus that, go hard things, one person it, they’r go stick out. that’ we’r tri eliminate. In meantime, there’ law tri win shootouts. and harden, houston damn near imposs stop. double-team pointless he’ spread 1-4 similar set; see coming, shred them. capela’ alreadi capabl flow pick roll action lob defend opt stay home anderson gordon. team hard show side pick roll run risk harden look top -- 6-foot-5 -- find open wing.  anderson gordon also get involv pick roll fun harden, leav either smaller defend him. If it’ him, it’ near-certainti harden’ go foul line -- help rocket defens made three. befor I got here, I alreadi knew pretti good passer, never realli good shooter around enough now, gordon said. and him, peopl like, couldn’t good enough point guard, it’ easy. he’ use ball creat score. when guy like ryan trevor floor, you’v got pick poison. somebody’ go open almost everi play court, find somebody. everi time come pick roll, know somebody’ open he’ go take shot. In harden’ first year houston, rocket obliter franchis record 3-pointer season 867. it’ way ever since. with harden freshli extend 2019 (he player option 2020), morey one aggress gm league, search begin anew anoth star. eventually, style the beard entic anoth difference-mak houston?  yes, morey said sunday, and (becaus of) season year -- expect go deep playoffs. thunder up. or, down? from juan felip murgueitio: i'v think lot thunder. i'v alway consid passiv nba fan i'v never realli support one team. the spur okc two mainstay but, know, noth terribl passionate. however, durant' decis grab (and us) surpris realli broke heart. onli I fulli realiz thunder' team. So I watch everi game play (mostli online, get much nba colombia). and though I realiz they'r flaw squad, I also know realli young.  So I want know assess give roster term potenti championship contender. Is enough talent develop take back to near top, rebuild inevitable? also, steven adam becom superstar ceil realli good? the current roster? not much chanc championship material. It good roster, again, construct durant mind. victor oladipo terrif third option, i’m sure he’ll second -- that’ critic vic. okc need domanta saboni develop quickly, too. As adams, I think star possible, likely, given work ethic. I don’t see becom offens monster, he’ certainli capabl reliabl 18-20 point guy enough touches. I woke new orleans/angri world alone. from alexand hudetz: the pelican screw up, havent they? davi averag 31.1 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 3.0 bpg, 1.7 spg, shoot 50.2 percent 81.4 percent line pelican seem alreadi destin lotteri start 0-5. yes, jrue holiday reason world sit long want must take care famili (I realli hope wife & daughter ultim fine healthy), player alreadi injured. still pelican screw up. and could see come sinc trade ariza asik gave overblown contract – addit (over-)pay gordon, evan ajinca.  natur davi seem bit frustrated. but pelican lock davi least 2019. still I think everi basketbal fan earth (with except pelican fans) want see davi compet championship soon possibl spin treadmil new orlean halv career over. My question is: shouldnt team stack trade-asset (like boston) throw much asset possibl new orlean exchang get davis? it’ clear nobodi new orlean want trade franchis player somebodi give multipl futur lotteri pick bunch young player -- wouldnt right time start proper rebuild? pelican fan may want hear altern view fring reach playoff davi final leav free-agent. If new orlean would trade davi deadlin end season boston, celtic would still massiv collect asset offer. the longer wait, less less pick left ainge’ treasur chest. My trade scenario: boston gives: 2017 first round draft pick brooklyn (swap, boston), 2018 brooklyn first rounder, 2019 first memphis, one two 2nd rounders, J. brown, amir johnson, bradley smart for davi (and mayb salari work, asik). nah. way earli pel think trade franchis bunch pick may may pan out. new orlean cap room next summer tyrek evans’ holiday’ salari come off, pel better hit free agent homer. If roster isn’t significantli improv time next year? circl wagon afraid. apparently, I love l.a. from jay srinivasan: one team beaten three team top 15, yet place among them. what gives? can’t imagin you’r think of, jay. but gander week’ totwm! calm nerves. send questions, comments, carnivoran familiar rule 18-1 offici rule golf to daldridgetntgmail.com.
