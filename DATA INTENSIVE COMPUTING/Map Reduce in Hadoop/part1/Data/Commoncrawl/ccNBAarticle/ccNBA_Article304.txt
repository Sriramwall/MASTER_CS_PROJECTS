He didn’t fetch much interest summer philly sign johnson front-court depth cheap one-year deal (in case sixer find taker okafor 2017-18). besid draft fultz, offseason decis sign redick. while philadelphia ranked 10th 3-pointer made last season, 3-point percentag rank 25th. philli suppos next redick former lotteri pick nik stauskas, dud sinc arriv sacramento. while ad redick pricey pickup ($23 million), he' one-year deal win-win sides. redick help 3-point shooting, also bring solid locker-room charact team without much term veteran help. for change, there' enthusiasm philli sixers. ticket jersey sell fan think playoffs. perhap might wise slow roll, though, plenti young team discov next step slipperi one. but everyth sixer gone last four seasons, player fan earn right think posit change. remember, play east, anyth possibl -- even basketbal philli late april. come next: orlando magic To check rest seri schedule, click here. veteran nba writer shaun powel work newspap public 25 years. you e-mail him here or follow ontwitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting.  copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network.
