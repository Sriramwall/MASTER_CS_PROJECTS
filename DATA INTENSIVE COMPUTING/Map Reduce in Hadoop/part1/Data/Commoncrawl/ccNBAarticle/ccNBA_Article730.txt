            would sixer will deal spur star kawhi leonard?
           A seri good question follows. from collin iheanacho: … can give insight hawk situation? what’ plan long (tony) ressler’ patienc last rebuild? doe darvin ham realli chance? what outlook taylor jenkins, chri jent, keke lyles, rest coaching, develop train staffs? what thought best move why? I know it’ lot, we’r realli undeserv hawks-wis (and general) market like come know time here. ever sinc travi (schlenk, new gener manager) hire -- ressler scorch mike budenholz winning, bud pbo flaws, tanking, let team interview budenholzer, etc.-- we’v left look answers. My understand hawk want bring young coach grow team, continu develop young guy like john collin taurean prince. they’r interest squeak one two win could probabl get next season hire retread. they’r concentr half-dozen candid present, includ former grizzli coach dave fizdale, portland assist nate tibbet warrior assist jarron collins. (collin rapidli rise coach ranks; he’ realli sharp realli good rapport players.) ham’ list, too, though guess he’ll follow budenholz next gig; they’r pretti close.  ham assist remain contract, though they’v given permiss hawk interview elsewher choose; obviously, new coach, whoever is, leeway hire staff. there’ whole-scal houseclean planned; team’ train staff, includ well-regard lyles, remain atlanta. ressler remain board long-term plan build draft; constant contact ressler schlenk. the hawk five first-round next two year (one protect first cleveland could project two seconds); it’ schlenk staff bat somewher .600 .800 picks. they’v play trade machin sinc sweep rose city. from monica pascual mate’: As fan spur gener mr. popovich particular, I rack brain would best option, hypothet kawhi leonard trade, spurs. We know valu player today' nba, well know mr. buford mr. popovich give away less price (if avoid it). there much talk around (make sense, course), due recent event (the spur lose first round) I would like put tabl portland. would will sacrific c.j. mccollum break play chemistri damian lilllard? I bet so. wouldn't make sens team trade like leonard pau gasol (free cap space process) mccollum and a pack pick players? from lyle ruthven:   long time fan work. I wonder whether think either team would consid portland-san antonio trade? mccollum, zach collin al-farouq aminu kawhi pau gasol! with current situation, spur would feel like came top get mccollum, center swingman (and get gasol’ contract). and, portland could scari good lillard, leonard (the best two-way player league) by keep jusuf nurkic! If spur decid choic trade leonard, I don’t think portland would turn. noth c.j., I love, player two mentioned, leonard elite, top-10 talent. I think san antonio would ask either all-star return gaggl young player pick -- former think bring player get back contend statu next season, latter think it’ final time go earnest rebuild.  plus, I think they’d determin get western conference. If I spur i’d certainli seek philadelphia 76ers, trove desir assets. they'll either get first-round lo angel laker (if lakers' pick either first overal anywher 6-30 first round draft) unprotect first-round sacramento kings, wors 10th overall, well bunch young players, none prohibit contracts. let' posit sixer get kings' pick. what philly, sake argument, offer san antonio sacramento first, robert covington (whose extension, sign last year, goe next season) markel fultz leonard? that would give spur young dynamo fultz wouldn’t pressur number one pick san antonio -- would daili servic assist coach chip engelland, might best coach earth fix broken shot. they’d top 10 pick, could net number impact wings or guards. covington isn’t leonard, he’ damn good 3-and-d wing, one best league. the spur might ultim say no, they’d damn sure think long hard it. and potenti would leav philli ben simmons, joel embiid, kawhi leonard, j.j. redick dario saric start lineup. which ... god. I know he’ got oscar all, now, … man. from david coleman: It interest read debat reader gun control. It amaz american brit cultur differ topic. when discuss friends, simpli can't comprehend gun cultur ingrain across pond. I understand constitut birth right, sure can't held regard right freedom speech right vote. I guess one cultur differ -- american probabl never understand put wash machin kitchens!onto basketball-rel question -- assum agre sentiment, lebron scale all-tim playoff rank across multipl stats, point eclips kobe bryant premier nba player? well, say kobe premier nba player? he’ certainli top 10-15 all-tim discussion, bill russel 11 rings, michael jordan six. If mean among contemporari players, i’d argu tim duncan get signific argument good kobe was. As lebron vs. kobe, it’ tough, tough call. kobe rings, lebron’ put insan final number years. i’d put kobe ahead lebron point, barely; fourth career titl (in would eighth straight final team) jame might turn histor tide permanently. send questions, comment 7-eleven locat near procyonid friend munchi daldridgetntgmail.com.
