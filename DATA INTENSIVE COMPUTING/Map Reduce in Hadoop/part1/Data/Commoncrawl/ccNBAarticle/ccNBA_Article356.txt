So right number game nba regular season, would schedul look like?    david aldridge:a 70-game schedul would, imho, perfect everyon concerned. over cours six months, that' two fewer game per team per month. fan would bare notice. but player would. while sound like major reduction, I think would improv qualiti play. reduc 70 keep new mid-octob start date regular season would also allow two signific changes: schedule, team get schedul play christma day espn/abc tnt would get mandatori four day afterward famili home -- game dozen team christma dec. 30. and, would allow leagu make post-all-star break long wants. A whole week? No game follow saturday/sunday? fine me. especi earlier trade deadlin place, whole week everyon would allow newli acquir player signific practic time new team. now, owner would complain lose six home game revenu get them. but, really: fan milwauke realli go miss second game indiana detroit charlott given year? (and, vice versa fan teams.) steve aschburner: th right number 82. the ideal schedul would look like season’ mayb someth slightli airier. let’ let extra week fold 2017-18 schedul play see desir result rest recovery, mayb stretch thing addit week next season. better cut back to, say, 66 games, would reduc revenu owner players, end much fun compar team star across eras. say bye, too, modern player scale lifetim statist categori unless plan stick around extra three four seasons.

An improv nba calendar, me, like improv school calendar (for school-ag children, know i'm come from). the number day stay same. but start end date built break realli matter. would 12-game reduct 70 regular season contest satisfi involved?
