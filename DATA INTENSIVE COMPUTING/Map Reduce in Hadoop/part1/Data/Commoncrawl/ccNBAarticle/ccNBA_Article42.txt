            nerlen noel happi play time sinc return knee surgery.
           where 76er send nerlen noel? it’ longer question if, philli end three-man experi among noel, joel embiid jahlil okafor. it’ working, nobodi happi cloud noel’ uncertainti capabl caus angst distract team shown sign growth season, embiid final court miss two year recov foot injuries.  noel made clear think deserv play time play eight minut return; sixer push back, say hasn’t around enough season undergo minor knee oper make demands. coach brett brown said last week noel wouldn’t regular rotat time soon, unless embiid okafor got foul trouble. espn.com report noel want traded, hasn’t exactli refuted. It left team presid bryan colangelo tri clean mess last week, say team wasn’t bench noel time need see play together. the stuff came subsequ term discuss want traded, I can't say best cours action take, colangelo said. in fact, I would say ill-advised. It ill-advis valu probabl abil involv deal. translation: doesn’t mean can’t, won’t, ultim happen, noel open yap, need time get trade valu pull trigger.  so, divorc noel, acquir former GM sam hinki one first move draft night deal new orlean 2013 guard jrue holiday 2014 first-round pick, sixer seem inevit best interest concerned. but, philli do? what would good deal big massiv defens skill limit offens next threat behind 3-point line? we’r help. philli oper deficit everyon around leagu know trade likely. On hand, sixer won’t necessarili suffer short term floor embiid’ minut increase, they’ll get long look whether there’ hope embiid okafor work togeth meantime. and: expect season 76er littl higher, high; it’ like anyon philli expect playoff run. If colangelo opt wait summer make deal, won’t necessarili hurt. but he’ll pull trigger eventually. and so, deal would make sens contemplate, address potenti weak grade net posit sides. (these ideas, scoops.) In particular order preference: noel + futur second-round pick new orlean PG jrue holiday revers hinki bring holiday back. it' uneven trade money-wis (noel make $4.3 million; holiday make $11.2 million), sixer far cap easili take extra salary. philli desper need lead point guard; sergio rodriguez shoot 39.5 percent floor jerryd bayless year. holiday reason four-month rental sixer see stay healthi get back near all-star form ben simmon learn rope play PG pros. (the issu holiday’ wife, lauren, u.s. women’ soccer team star, recov brain surgeri give birth couple’ first child.) the pel tyrek evan back injuri finish season point, noel well worth nawlin look next year-plus. He display least acumen away basket last season. but greatest potenti pel would obvious defens end, big could take burden guard oppos center anthoni davis.  noel + F timoth luwawu-cabarrot F Ed davis, G shabazz napier the blazer desper need interior defens -- speak, dfl leagu defens rating, allow ghastli 115.8 point per 100 possessions, 28th point allow per game (112.8). thi longer feel-good stori last season; portland fix this, fast. napier get next burn play behind damian lillard; evan turner' ball, anyway, come game. davi rug guy work hard, he' capabl fix portland' aw defens himself; philly, he’d upgrad bench. So see noel come rose citi give defens presenc paint? napier would get point guard minut philli behind rodriguez, davi first-rat energi provid bench. luwawu-cabarrot, one philly' first-round pick year, get blazers' terrif coach staff develop slowly, sight. noel + SF robert covington toronto SF terrenc ross 2017 first-round pick (la clippers) toronto replac shot-block prowess bismack biyombo, excel playoff last season cleveland got $72 million orlando summer. noel mani thing biz does, make ton less money. the rap love jare sulling stuck-on-the-floor-gam isn’t go alter sorti lebron tristan thompson toronto see cleveland confer finals. meanwhile, bottom fallen covington’ stroke season -- he’ shoot 29.5 percent behind arc. but that’ follow two year much robust 36.3 percent combin 3s; he’d help toronto play small want need playoffs. and: colangelo happen GM draft ross eighth overal 2012 toronto. stuck behind demarr carrol 416, ross could get addit opportun (he’ fire 43 percent 3s) philly. the raptor also need anoth guarante contract book two year now, especi like late first come clips; sixer alway find someth it. noel oklahoma citi C joffrey lauvergne, G cameron payne, F josh huesti it’ kind deal thunder GM sam presti loves: get asset upside. noel wouldn’t start ahead steven adams, could see abl play defens challeng ene kanter bench. and wouldn’t idl trade 76ers; payn former first-round come injuri year could futur starter team doesn’t russel westbrook ball. huesti littl chanc play time okc first-round domanti saboni alreadi lock starter four; wouldn’t start philly, either, least he’d probabl get floor rather shuttl back forth d-leagu team.  In hearts, always. from penni baker: the written memories tribut craig fantastic! I appreci work efforts.  I wish hope emblem sagerstrong somehow includ nba uniforms-leagu wide-forever. mayb shoulder craig stand guid player. thanks, penny. while would inde incred tribut craig hashtag perman visible, i’m guess uniform patch far valuabl futur revenu stream team util way you’v suggested. i’m sure we’ll see sagerstrong number place around leagu futur years, though.

He truli love nba community. insid nba assess clippers' chanc without servic blake griffin. blame monstars. from eric webb: would (personally) put blake griffin minut restrict save playoff doc? He alreadi restrict sorts, eric. it’ enumer publicly, clippers’ medic staff alreadi held griffin coupl game season loads (the variou stress body, determin use wearabl technolog monitor thing increasingli accur forecast potenti injury) get high. but, question: i’m sure he’ll limit minutes-wis return remaind regular season, whether formal informally. would they cast paul over proceedings? from ben moore: My question hometown atlanta hawks: Do see trade paul millsap come month continu stay near bottom east standings? no. millsap versatil player, dwight howard’ back continu caus miss occasion game games, I think mike budenholz would rather paul plug mike muscala (not muscala bad; far it). the way bud want play, even howard, need multipl player pass shoot, paul’ best far. not mention millsap highli sought-aft free agent next summer; i’d surpris mani team offer much know get shot seven month give hawk anything. send questions, comments, holiday classic improv the big man to daldridgetntgmail.com.
