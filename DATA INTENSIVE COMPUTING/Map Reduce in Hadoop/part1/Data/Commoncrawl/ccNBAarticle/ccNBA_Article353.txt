            paul georg mani factor assess free agenc come call next summer.
           we’r go repeat oscar thing, we? from deven parikh: with russel westbrook sign extens paul georg second thought stay okc beyond upcom season, impact lebron james' decis go lakers? becaus pg-13 go lala land, neither lebron, right? well, there’ lot unpack there. while georg give okc genuin listen next summer, doesn’t mean he’ lock return. i’d still give laker strong chanc get him, whether that’ lebron anyon else. As lbj, I think it’ still like leaves, also doesn’t mean he’ lock laker does. In addition, success failur cavs’ season -- long-term health outlook isaiah thoma -- still unknown. i’m tri buoy cleveland fans’ hope he’ll stay; it’ earli know certainti year go go lebron cav owner dan gilbert go deal one anoth -- they’ll deal one anoth -- next 12 months. I hope brought enough superstar everyone, from brian ip: I agre stan van gundy' propos get rid draft sound awesome! yet sake discuss I tri consid potenti drawback. one thing I specul that, draft, rooki project franchise-chang player (e.g lebron, tim duncan, shaquil o'neal), quit like sign big-market teams, team would also clear hous make room them, like target major free agents. So system would probabl work rookies, san antonio might never get talent like tim duncan again. franchise-chang player come along often. it’ true franchise-chang rare. So net-net team size get franchise-changers, would way well incom rooki free agents. but I disagre would elimin small market they’r small markets. let’ say shaquil o’neal IV come school next summer draft-fre nba, abl sign anyone; whether would rooki except cap, team would abl use cap space argument anoth column. for sake argument, let’ say team could spend whatev want, keep financi play field equal. brooklyn could creat enorm room quickly. the net play nba’ biggest media market. soniv would almost certainli monster opportun local endors deal would reach eight figur annually. the shoe compani would saliv possibl someon dynam nyc. but: net aren’t, currently, good. So soniv would weigh play l.a. laker -- equal bad right -- chicago (ditto). On hand, could play franchis like spur histori win championship domin big men. I don’t know hypothet soniv would do, he’ hypothetical. what i’m say team small market like san antonio histori success wouldn’t automat rejected. the spur got lamarcu aldridg -- franchis player, all-star one top free agent avail -- 2015. the laker offer him. the knick offer him. but went spur -- hadn’t gone san antonio, well might sign phoenix. everyone’ motiv different. span globe, bring constant varieti sports. from christoph hughes: the solut make all-star game competit simple. expand roster 15 make usa vs world. fan vote start five, coach choos next nine players. after player announced, fan stream vote last man standing. lebron crew never want lose game ... I believ leagu 25 percent foreign. it time! i’d problem idea, christopher; nhl seem made switch without lose fan interest (and, i’m sure true puckhead would argue, game even better result). there certainli enough intern star game today -- denni schroeder, goran dragic, gianni antetokounmpo, kristap porzingi joel embiid would pretti decent start five, yes? -- make competit game. the problem would come player agent repres american-born players; aw lot incent exist contract make all-star appear would fall waysid leagu implement proposal. the pushback would ... substantial. send questions, comment florida men news thing lead polic photo todaldridgetntgmail.com.
