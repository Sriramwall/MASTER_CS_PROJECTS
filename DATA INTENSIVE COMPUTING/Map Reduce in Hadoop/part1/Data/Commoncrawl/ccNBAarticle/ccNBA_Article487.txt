            paul georg lou william among player earn all-star reserv spots.
              the all-star reserv announc tuesday night. name player didn’t make cut total deserv spot next month' game?    david aldridge:  l williams. those empti number (23.3 point per game, 40.5 percent 3-pointers) he' put season; despit injuri two-way contract oppon tri get locker room, LA clipper right edg playoff western conference, william main reason. all due respect draymond green, who' vital player warriors, new sweet lou (hudson; googl him) home court stapl next month. steve aschburner:  lou williams. normal william would non-factor all-star game, given nich role offens bench. but press heavi duti clippers, start 14 game averag career-high 32.2 minutes. At 23.3 point 40.5 percent shoot arc, 31-year-old williams’ best (only?) chanc snag all-star berth. I wouldn’t bump anyon west reserv fit williams, squad 13th spot, he’d pick one. shaun powell:  i thought part right player made cut. you could quibbl there, I must choose, tobia harri detroit pistons. perhap instead kevin love, mayb kristap porzingis, neither consist sinc open night like harris, who' breakout-lik year. two things: I care much andr drummond dwight howard get in, miami heat got shut (there' singular star there). also, I want all-star team stock entertain player exhibit game. the all-nba team merit, besides, team import anyway -- much tougher make. john schuhmann:  in east especially, resum player convers (a well coupl player selected) flaw one way another. In west, paul georg vs. damian lillard vs. lou william convers fascinating. georg best defend best team three. but two guy score effici bigger role offense. lillard' role littl bigger williams, williams' team better offensively. I can't fault coach put lillard game realli 13-man all-star rosters, though addit spot would still leav one three guy feel left out. sekou smith:  for first time year I find outrag player two left mix all-star game. it' rare I walk away process feel like fan (players and media, too,) got right on th starter league' coach nail reserves. the one guy I think littl salti right paul george, play well season alongsid russel westbrook, shown worthi two-way player elit tag earn indiana pacer. If I cynic, i'd swear there wa backlash against george bas depart indiana. but I can't identifi player western confer I could justify remov make room george. sometim enough spot player deserv all-star honors.        copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
