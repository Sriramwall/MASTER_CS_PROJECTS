            bradley beal lead wizard score season 23.9 point per game.
           the thought, back 2012, they’d get michael kidd-gilchrist. pick third draft, washington wizard knew anthoni davi would go board first new orleans. but charlott pick second, then-bobcat come 7-59 lockout season -- worst percentag leagu histori -- mani around leagu bobcat (now hornets) would go offens tri draw back fans. the team’ lead scorer 2011-12 gerald henderson (15.1 point per game).  but bobcat went defense, take davis’ kentucki teammate, forward michael kidd-gilchrist, second overall. mayb charlott hire new, defensive-mind coach, mike dunlap. Or mayb michael jordan saw scotti pippen kidd-gilchrist. whatev reason, wizards, pick third, got player want -- florida freshman guard bradley beal. (thi isn’t after-the-fact second-guessing; they’d said, privately, draft.) for years, kidd-gilchrist beal struggl injuries, juri better night.  but today, evid point wizard win. still 24, beal becom one league’ best scorer position, team john wall compris one league’ top hand backcourts. beal start everi one washington’ 49 game season, start 77 last season, averag career high point (23.9), rebound (4.4) assist (3.8), name first all-star team last week. It big moment beal, who’d alreadi establish elit shooter (and gotten $128 million wizard 2016), who’d lab trainer drew hanlen sever year work ballhandl footwork. thi spent childhood get beaten four football-play brother st. louis.  yet despit individu achievements, includ 51-point masterpiec portland wall out, year’ wizard disappointment. they’r fifth place eastern conference, dream top two finish year, take boston celtic seven game 2017 eastern confer semifinals. that’ washington’ season end three playoff appear sinc 2014. but wizard flounder bad team season, they’r five game .500, closer playoff top seed.  the poor start led disastr team meet week ago noth quell angst among players. it’ forc beal find voic leader, come shell tri lead team someth meaning -- talk extran piffle, like cavali realli didn’t want play playoff last year. me: so, byron, bryon, brandon bruce, beal brother got all-star news first? bradley beal: I heard girl first. she call told me.
