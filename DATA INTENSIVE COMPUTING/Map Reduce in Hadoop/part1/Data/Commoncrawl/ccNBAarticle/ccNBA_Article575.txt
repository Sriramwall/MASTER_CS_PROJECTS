            So far, georg hill start five game play cavs.
           the first question father had, heard news was: go wear 22, right? anoth chanc anoth nance. A gener ago, larri nance, sr., key part great cleveland cavali team -- one magic johnson famous dub the team ’90s late ’80s. michael jordan chicago bull snuf out. now, almost 30 year later, son, larri nance, jr., league’ team’ permiss take father’ jersey rafters, retir 1995, wear again. thi time, though, odd cleveland’ favor. the cav generation’ magic, there’ jordan found. there assort kevin durant stephen currys; jame harden chri pauls, sure. but cavaliers, shock nba world trade deadlin two week ago three major deal blew old, tire roster revit one morning, thing matters: engag lebron james, bounc toes. No one els earth bring anyon impactful. or, kyle korver put it, I super excit team. nance, jr., jordan clarkson came lo angel lakers. rodney hood came utah jazz. georg hill came sacramento kings. out went isaiah thoma dwyan wade; jae crowder iman shumpert; derrick rose chan frye. three huge cut first-year gener manag kobi altman, also held onto unprotect first-round pick cav got boston (via brooklyn) kyri irv deal last summer. hill newcom put start lineup. the other revit cleveland’ bench, give korver room oper defens suddenli stay attach clarkson’ attack -- he’ sixth leagu bench scoring, behind lou williams, tyrek evans, eric gordon, nikola mirot hood -- hood’ spot-up nance’ rim runs.   they’r mostli young -- hill 30-someth -- springy. they pace coach tyronn lue beg year, without success. they went boston, practic time, much less time learn tendencies, hors boston celtics, get deflect runouts, buri 3-pointer jump bench like no. 15 seed beat no. 2 seed ncaas. the small thing don’t know -- plays, direct practic (clarkson got horribl lost first day), live -- incorpor fly. there’ time. there’ six week left regular season, kevin love still back lineup, hungri team right cleveland’ haunch east who’d love surpass cav third conference. james, course, ideas. I think play well tonight, even though lost, said thursday’ game, loss resurg washington wizards. I hate losing, obviously, I think way played, way share ball, defens fli around well. those guys, play better us tonight. (but) I like start I like direct we’r head in. hill chase titl indiana, james’ miami heat teams, pacer young paul georg tall roy hibbert tough david west crazi lanc stephenson. hood made playoff last year jazz. but nanc clarkson laker team expectations. cleveland, course, ultim expectation, james’ free agenc looming. it’ different, nanc jr. said. we’r kind still learn adjust. me, i’v kind pride whatev take win, whether I laker univers wyoming. I feel like I fit right here, kind play style team need -- get glass, run catch lobs. 
    cavali guard jordan clarkson
   clarkson didn’t believ he’d traded. the laker given $50 million deal 2016. he, nanc jr., brandon ingram lonzo ball go core new laker team need star player spoke wheel. the morn deadline, I sleep couch, clarkson said. they call -- rob (pelinka, lakers’ gm) magic (johnson) calling. We shootaround; game day. So I kind like push phone side. I still tri get sleep. but I woke calll back gave news. At least clarkson engag new journey familiar face nance, jr. hill leav 1-month old 2-year old come cleveland. live suitcas right tri find place stay, newborn baby, it’ kind tough, hill said. mi fianc back texas, kind take littl bit me, wake everi two hour baby. i’m happi right now. but hill vet thrill get sacramento. the adjust rel quick (the film room go friend, korver said). the basic stuff new players’ ipads; lue coach simplifi rest. (lue run clarkson’ hood’ favorit set l.a. utah first game cleveland. clarkson stunned. I got you, lue said response. I know what’ go on.) clarkson also adjust new phenomenon, one everi player first get floor james. the first two games, I hesitating, clarkson said. and i’d open. and i’d like, i’m open. and i’d take anoth dribbl i’d like, ’man, i’m still open.’ even kickout stuff, kind sit second you’r like, ain’t shot you’r use taking. lue throw kind differ lineup floor. team play hill make hood put ball deck, sure. but cleveland’ got lot athlet personnel deal team like oklahoma citi thunder, toronto raptors, minnesota timberwolv rockets, blew cavs’ door aw decemb january. (love, broke left hand earlier month, said last week believ he’ll around anoth month returning.) james, per sources, wasn’t expect huge deal cav deadline, mayb small one two, inform night deadlin big possibl pipeline. He obvious was, is, close wade, respect rose’ work get healthi enjoy frye’ personality. He didn’t dislik thomas, obvous didn’t mix well floor. it’ clear jame engaged. he’ vocal new teammat split -- aw januari -- back norms. but say independ decis his, reaction work altman did. I think I refocus myself, said. even deadlin happen trade happened, I refocu understand i’m leader team, I mental sharp mental strong throughout anything. So even trade, I plan us team rest season. that mindset. and saw minnesota game (when jame hit game-win shot buzzer). We hadn’t made trade then, minnesota game I start chang mindset. So that’ I it’ I now. I think team be, realli good. we’v got 20-plu game left tri figur out. I think that, continu now, I think we’ll okay. but remak team beat boston and/or toronto seven game isn’t go easy. the wizard slow cav carv defens thursday. On sunday, danni green drop five 3-pointer them, cleveland couldn’t put ball pressur dejount murray san antonio spurs, alreadi without kawhi leonard, comfort without meaning contribut either toni parker manu ginobili. and cavs’ upcom schedul go bear. not opponents, per se, workload. for next six week -- span 21 games, april 6 -- cleveland never one day games. they play san antonio sunday; play brooklyn tuesday. off wednesday; vs. philli thursday. off friday; host denver saturday. and on, includ west coast trip begin two day cav play detroit. there almost practic time rest regular season. thi challeng happen late season, korver said. I think we’r optimist figur out. I think we’v shown first two game -- even (thursday) stretch -- we’r far already. but there’ definit lot thing get better at. We use guys’ skill better. the altern wasn’t go cut it, though. james’ goal championship now, old cav -- old key word -- weren’t championship material. thi new collect show perform april may, someth yet do. but they’v given jame belief. and go long way. it’ go challenging, jame said. it’ go challenging. but I accept challenge, I think guy excit tri learn everi day. the good thing is, we’r go get point we’r play everi day, learn floor. we film sessions, walkthrough continu tri keep mind sharp. it’ have. We lean that. we’r like washington; we’r like toronto. obviously, boston new guy they’r figur well. but we’r like lot team hang hat chemistri long we’v together. it’ us kind fast track -- shortcut process, fast track we’r tri do. and see happens.    longtim nba reporter, columnist naismith memori basketbal hall famer david aldridg analyst tnt. you e-mail him here, find hi archiv here andfollow twitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
