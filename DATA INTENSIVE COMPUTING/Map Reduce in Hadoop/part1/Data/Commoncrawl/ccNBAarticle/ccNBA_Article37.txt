david aldridg tnt analyst daldridgetntarch dec 19, 2016 10:28 AM ET who chief beneficiari new collect bargain agreement? wait, I answer one myself: us! everyon love basketbal buoy offici announc last week leagu players’ union reach tent agreement new seven-year deal (with six years), avoid potenti lockout next summer. the deal maintain current band player receiv basketbal relat incom 49 51 percent (though expect money nba system, players’ cut almost certainli 51), maintain one-and-done draft system, allow player declar draft year high school class graduate. that next public argument union maintain either institut go forward -- object leagu substanti increas across board everi categori player contract -- show sanguin $24 billion televis money make everyone. what long-term ramif new collect bargain agreement? nba commission adam silver nation basketbal player associ execut director michel robert motiv keep thing move along current path. A major owner achiev financi stability, buoy much league’ enchanc revenu share plan new TV money, financi giveback player come 2011 lockout. but player divid much, much larger financi pie five year ago -- $1.5 billion richer -- likelihood bigger increas year come. we came tabl good faith, nbpa presid chri paul said sunday. our execut committee, michel guy union amazing. they work countless hour … throughout collaboration, far differ owners, tri get page work best league. everything’ go perfect, it’ work best league. the smart thing say idea ramif new deal everi team be. but warriors’ format nba’ latest super-team sign kevin durant last summer spook leagu mani teams, put sever safeguard 2011 lockout tri prevent happening. So leagu union agre sever modif exist rule tri give team abil retain core player poached. the previou cba singl design player exception team use one player rooki scale contract. that player could get five-year max deal extens team hit final year rooki deal -- essence, give new six-year deal team. the idea team would better opportun keep young core player could tie max dollar hit free agenc -- and, indeed, sever team took advantag rule -- oklahoma citi (russel westbrook), houston (jame harden), clipper (blake griffin), chicago (derrick rose), indiana (paul george), cleveland (kyri irving) washington (john wall). those player elig get max player less seven years’ experi final year rooki contract -- 25 percent cap. but could also earn 30 percent cap new deal reach certain criteria rooki deals: name first, second third all-nba team twice, vote starter all-star team twice win nba most valuabl player award once. (that’ dpe better known derrick rose rule, then-bul guard mvp award 2011.) the new cba four design player except -- two player still rooki deals, two new one veterans. they work before: team give four player roster new six-year contract -- five-year max extens ad final year exist deals. the idea give incumb team still chanc keep core group together. the veteran dpe use either give player extens re-sign free agent. player draft current team elig extens team use dpe re-sign free agents. the criteria veteran dpe similar player rooki deal -- player leagu mvp (or, veterans’ case, defens player year) made one three all-nba team previou season, all-nba/dpoy two previou three seasons, leagu mvp previou three seasons. the new rule would, example, allow oklahoma citi offer westbrook new six-year max contract next juli would keep potenti becom free agent follow 2017-18 season. (westbrook alreadi qualifi veteran dpe, second-team all-nba select 2014-15 first-team 2015-16.) westbrook agre three-year extens okc last year $85 million bump salari final year old deal ad two addit years, 2018-19 season -- final year player option. after next season, though, westbrook also elig max deal player 10 years’ experi -- 35 percent cap rather 30 percent. As everyth cba-related, I check sunday great larri coon, whose cba primer gold standard check everi bit cap minutae. coon point westbrook opt final year current deal, couldn’t sign new extens august 2018 -- two year sign previou one. If elect opt last year current deal, westbrook could sign five-year extens thunder $219 million summer 2018. By contrast, westbrook opt deal explor unrestrict free agenc 2018, could get four-year deal anoth team. It would still humung amount coin -- $162.5 million. but last year incumb team offer (and, keep mind, new deal, incumb team offer annual eight percent raises; non-incumb offer five percent raises) becom stagger amount money walk away. but player turn max offer like that, least team pretti good idea much earlier process go lose him, allow team plan ahead certainty. that shouldn’t issu team like warriors, even though convent wisdom posit money system make harder superteams stay intact. As mani point out, example, warrior may problem bring whole roster back give stephen curri kevin durant separ max deal next summer -- $200 million curry, golden state bird rights, qualifi veteran dpe, allow 35 percent team’ cap -- $36 million next year durant, bird rights. the warrior would thu clear cap room give durant max. the warrior littl $37 million commit 2017-18 alreadi five players, includ klay thompson ($17.8 million) draymond green ($16.4 million). If 2017-18 cap remain current project $103 million, golden state need $36 million cap room durant -- unless agre smaller deal warrior earli bird free agent -- mandatori cap hold fill rest roster would hamstr warriors’ abil sign free agents, includ 2015 final mvp andr iguodala veteran guard shaun livingston. 
    chri paul, new benefit packag retir player 
   but mid-level except also increasingli significantli new rules, elit team like warrior weapon lure veteran player may will take short-term financi haircut play contender. those except avail rebuild team like heat well. but cap room import team like miami, hope enough room next summer abl add two max players. but cap expert albert nahmad point last week, heat could face difficulti execut quick rebuild. To make sure current young player contract also benefit new deal, rooki scale deal also increas new deal, slide scale, depend year draft previou three years. the upshot, though, team like heat less cap room they’d previous budget player rooki deal make money schedul old cba. there won’t much impact team bulk player sign long term, like cleveland. the cavs’ top seven player -- lebron james, irving, kevin love, tristan thompson, j.r. smith, iman shumpert chan frye -- contract 2017-18, jame player option 2018-19 season, irving, love, thompson smith alreadi ink season, too. (becaus love came cleveland via trade, he’ elig one new dpes; irving, though, would be.) despit econom improv rank file, paul proud new except rais current players, dramat enhanc benefit packag retir players, paid union league. that’ bigger game, paul said. that’ bigger one player now. that’ nba itself, far player came us player come us. young guy 19, 20 year old, idea mean right now. they don’t know co-pay is, don’t know stuff is. I think we’r first leagu put place. it’ big. and realli bring player togeth … the coolest part travel road arenas, former player broadcast stuff like that, come say ‘thank you.’ I alway tell them, too, ‘not me. it’ player made happen.’ and it’ huge. you’v got family. you know big is. there ill a-brew toward rest/for I dream money bag tonight. from lee cheatham: the ongo controversi issu rest healthi player preval nba, much chagrin avid fans, they'r miss opportun watch best athlet world showcas talents. coach gregg popovich adopt mainten program strategi sever year ago keep age veteran fresh long playoff run, morph coach period rest young players. there' public outcri denounc egregi act aforement ardent aficionados, ticket holders, sponsor et al. some analyst recommend rest player home games, injustic local fan whose unwav support enabl star player sign lucr contracts.

Do recommend coach maintain players' health still provid optim product court fans? I think, understandable, practic rest player terribl fans. team go it, though, medic staff recommend rest, figur deal future.

I remain use idiot. from hernan alberto roja roldan: hello, you'r idiot! just kidding. hehe. your list great, I mostli agre it. however, I think t-mac vinc carter. No favorit anything, mcgradi two-tim score champion clutch player (13 point 33 seconds). also, add rondo? 18-18-18 game, someth chamberlain big O ever accomplished. score 44 heat confer finals, led leagu assist thrice, 20+ assist turnovers, hold franchis record differ franchises, etc. just thoughts. you could make case mcgradi -- next list. the playoff record make difficult me, I understand wasn’t tmac’ fault, necessarily. I don’t think rondo rise greatest 75 level. he’ very, good point guard great select playoff games, he’ one 75 greatest player time opinion. and … dj? from andrew cavarlho: whi denni johnson keep get left behind? hall fame top 75? lot player list got NO rings. denni ring 2 teams, superson celtics. No rings: barkley, gari payton, chri paul, mitch richmond. none 4 player done better denni johnson. A fair argument player larri bird call best he’ ever play with, andrew. I would includ because, titl matter, aren’t criteria i’d use pick 75 greatest players. you wouldn’t realli argu elgin baylor isn’t one 75 best player ever didn’t play championship team (yes, I know technic lakers’ 1972 team, he’d retir start season), right? Or DJ better jerri west oscar robertson two ring one?
