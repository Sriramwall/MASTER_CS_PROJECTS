            In gianni antetokounmpo, buck superstar build contend around.
           the milwauke buck notion. the buck believ they’r top-four team eastern conference. they believ better current sixth place posit east. and believ least apparatu championship organ place. that belief extend jason kidd. kidd’ never-dul three-plu season bucks’ coach end week ago team fire him, question franchis haven’t. they come milwauke month away open new downtown arena, paid past present ownership -- $100 million former owner herb kohl, $150 million current owner marc lasri we eden -- $250 million wisconsin resid 20 years, grow $400 million taxpay subsidi interest. they come team tri go beyond encourag show first round last year, took toronto raptor six games. they come team’ franchis player superstar, gianni antetokounmpo, start four-year, $100 million extens season run 2021, continu weigh direct franchis -- go without kidd, close. (reportedly, antetokounmpo inform kidd fired, manag did.) 
    buck GM jon horst
   but bucks’ inexplic aw defense, pedestrian offens despit antetokounmpo’ nightli highlight-reel level attack lack overal identity, believed, threaten season’ possibilities, futur years. the differ is, franchise’ evolution, opinion, ‘championship bust’ mantra, milwaukee’ first-year gener manager, jon horst, said phone sunday afternoon, buck third straight game interim coach joe prunty, who’ll team rest season. I think long-term view, ‘championship bust’ mantra, horst said. we fulli intend team compet championship long period time, hope win championships. We want that. there’ lot step franchis hasn’t consecut playoff 14 years, hasn’t first-round seri in, I think, 17 seasons. [editor’ note: horst correct, milwaukee' last playoff seri win came 2001, reach east finals] between stage championship lot realli critic import steps. you short window, want maxim everi part window. thi chanc us maxim part window, build last year. We want better last year. milwauke never reach height defens kidd first season there, 2014-15, buck second leagu defens rate (99.3), tie first steal (9.6), led nba oppon turnov (17.4 per game) eighth point allow (97.4). milwauke wasn’t pretti halfcourt, buck turn -- did, lot -- races. assist coach sean sweeney demand defens end got results. point guard brandon knight led team score assist got seriou all-star consideration. yet kidd push move knight, buck trade deadlin 2015, send phoenix sun three-way deal philadelphia 76er brought michael carter-williams, guard size kidd like position. but mcw’ problem shoot ball consist didn’t dissip made 19 three 79 game two season play kidd. and buck crater defens well, drop 22nd defens rate 17th point allow 2015-16, number rose slightli 19th ninth last season, rooki year malcolm brogdon provid steadi play point. milwauke hope get eric bledso phoenix greg monro novemb would bolster chop point attack, initi improv earli -- milwauke fifth defens rate bledsoe’ first 11 game -- buck slid back, 18th defens rating, 14th point allow 23rd oppon 3-point percentag sinc deal. their zeal trap everi high pick roll within inch life made easier attack long run. the inference, though one say openly, kidd didn’t listen enough -- management, ownership, mayb staff. (the buck kept prunty, sweeney greg foster kidd’ staff, fire eric hugh frank johnson, end relationship tim grgurich, legendari coach belov player around leagu quiet work improve, fanfare.) It nonetheless leav prunti challenge. the biggest thing would consistency, horst said. I think we’v shown, offens defens side, compet high level compet top four team confer (though buck 2-8 overal boston, toronto, cleveland miami far year), mayb top eight 10 team league. We consistently. that’ realli biggest thing. and beyond that, organization, experts. 
    buck GM jon horst
   we expert perform side, expert coach staff, expert front offic management, expert busi side. and want accountable. We want self-reflective. We want tri continu better everi day. We love roster. We love young core. We believ group. we’r constantly, seat, look improv get better. it’ like, make coach chang we’v done job. the buck also face challeng three-head ownership group, includ jami dinan -- like lasri edens, hedg fund billionair new york. the three men, bought team kohl 2014 $550 million, make franchise’ big decis together. but, like precog minor report, occasion disagree. espn report last summer lasri dinan sign make justin zanik, bucks’ assist gm, longtim leagu exec former agent, team’ new front offic face, replac john hammond, who’d taken later move GM spot orlando. hammond draft antetokounmpo midway first round 2015 -- when, mani around leagu scout the greek freak thought unusu potential, fewer will pull trigger then-19-year-old. but edens, per espn, wasn’t readi give job zanik. even buck open search up, settl former hawk GM we wilcox, denver assist GM artura karnisova zanik finalists, eden still didn’t sign zanik. eventually, three agre give GM job horst, who’d bucks’ director basketbal oper nine years. but eden horst’ introductori press conference. eden bucks’ governor -- team’ offici repres leagu -- thus, per leagu rules, final say team’ decisions, way jeani buss lo angel lakers. but condit buy team lasry, eden cede titl lasri two years. it’ unusual, say league. they’r overli hands-on. it’ there’ three them, say leagu exec who’ dealt bucks. what organ nba someth like that? I think that’ come anything. A leagu sourc knowledg team’ thinking, though, insist disagr among three owners, though, fire kidd. everyon full agreement, sourc said. that would repres signific chang relationship lasri kidd. kidd then-agent, power excel head jeff schwartz, good friend lasry. they guest wed lasry’ daughter kidd retired. (when kidd decid becom coach, first nets, hire anoth excel rep, former nation basketbal players’ associ counsel hal biagas. biaga head players’ union leagu legends’ championship seri esport franchises.) It lasri push hire kidd milwauke 2014, even though buck hadn’t yet fire incumb coach, larri drew. the way kidd came left milwaukee, then, kind unfortun symmetri buck would well-advis repeat. yet buck believ signific invest they’v made basketbal oper side last years. lasry, eden dimon succeed make franchis statewid entiti previously, rais $100 million minor investor wisconsin. they bolster team’ sport medicin staff, made suki hobson one women head strength condit coach nba team, made deal new arena, set open time 2018-19 season centerpiec revit downtown corridor. and got big-tim free agent sign milwaukee, monro turn new york knick 2015 three-year, $51 million deal bucks. yet they’v stuck place, pretti much, last three years. they 41-41 ’14-’15; 42-40 last season. but horst believ punt rest season, make go remain peopl staff. I trust people, trust peopl opportun have, horst said. with transition, we’v given individu staff opportun voice, input, prove even better job before. it’ trust peopl place care company, care goals, one focu one agenda get better everi day help us toward goals. antetokounmpo close kidd, gave playmak freedom early, diplomat move afterward. I reach him, told report last week. he big part success league, that’ one characterist -- i’m loyal peopl I work with. antetokounmpo’ relationship team, per sources, remain solid. but obviously, buck can’t whiff next coach, whether it’ prunti group capabl former coach current job would certainli interest groom antetokounmpo’ alreadi blossom game. it’ realli simpl -- gianni care best chanc win, horst said. he want know understand sign we’r go throw away season, believ teammat potenti someth special season. We believ that, believ them. gianni want know chanc win now, go forward. and feel case, he’ fine. and I mani convers -- even specif jason kidd thing. just general. and I talk lot guys. yet sens among least outsid bucks’ organ that, paraphras someon talk someth els entirely, they’r littl high supply. they hardest piec get, cours -- young, legit, ticket-selling, charismat superstar antetokounmpo intern appeal. but good player like khri middleton malcolm brogdon, don’t championship roster yet. horst say team’ self-scout ongo never ending, don’t pie sky, unreach ambition. how evalu that, make sure you’r unrealistic?, said. you constantli re-think, re-evaluate, will look thing differently. for us, I think think compet top four. We compet closer team that’ top four rather 9 13 spot … trend toward team that’ home playoff team. If you’r home playoff team, chanc win series, win series, chanc win next series. to me, that’ short-term view. it’ realli long-term view: get want compet championships? At end year, fell littl short, finish five, finish six, whatev is, evalu figur weren’t good enough, it’ job figur get better improv that.    longtim nba reporter, columnist naismith memori basketbal hall famer david aldridg analyst tnt. you e-mail him here, find hi archiv here andfollow twitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
