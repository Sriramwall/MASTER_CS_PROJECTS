            mark cuban fine $600,000 nba comment tanking.
           the nba fine dalla maverick owner mark cuban $600,000 honest. cuban told naismith memori hall famer juliu erv erving’ podcast coupl week ago told player recent dinner lose best option. adam (silver) would hate hear that…(but) want player understand. As player, know even though may agree, least respect fact someon took time talk you, understood perspective, you’r go give feedback, you’r part process. but leagu fine cuban call public statement detriment nba three day later. and silver sent memo 30 team last week detail league’ position.   offici releas cuban' fine throughout period, silver wrote, we care distinguish effort team may make rebuild rosters, includ personnel chang cours sever seasons, circumst player coach floor take step lose games.  the former legitim strategi construct success team within confin leagu rules; latter -- found hope never see nba -- place game. yet cuban way, evid contrari emerged, state maverick lose game purpose; is, player intent miss shots, put forth effort defens let team score, anyth like that. (even silver acknowledg memo leagu no basi time conclud maverick team give anyth less best effort court, mark assur us case.) so, fine? wa cuban said incendiary? ‘’mark knew comment public, surpris candid, that' mark is, said one high-rank offici anoth team weekend. to comment indic tank strategi set expect playoff possibility. the consol make playoff lottery. you can't blame team tri turn lemon (losing) lemonad (top 4 pick). the leagu need find way reward losing. exactly. what cuban said spot -- lose improv mavericks’ draft posit was, is, best quickest way dalla get better start win game again. that doesn’t mean everyon agre cuban blunt. I think total inappropri say players, said anoth extrem high-rank team offici anoth team. whatev team’ strategi may be, I firmli believ player alway play win. the fine meaningless mark; fact, sometim I think enjoy public get fines. but. 
    former atlanta hawk GM stan kasten, rebuilding
   We ask peopl truth lie intentions. We tell kid lie worth telling, tell truth, matter painful, alway best choice. So cuban honest tell truth, short-term lose make sens franchise’ long-term interests, he’ reliev 600 larg league. meanwhile, philadelphia 76er laud -- revel slogan, trust process, celebr team’ ardent support -- whose central tenet lose, keep losing, could draft player good enough build around win road. which is, exactly, dalla now. indeed, increas tank logic extens analytics-domin league. If three greater two -- reason behind primaci 3-pointer today’ nba -- anyth get ping-pong ball hopper correct thing do. you can’t embrac part number pleasant. thi flip side. buri one’ head sand pretend team don’t doesn’t make sense. everyon everi sport, don’t recal suck luck, chant indianapoli colts’ fan 2012 nfl draft? what major leagu baseball’ houston astro lose 324 game 2011-13? were tri win games, imagin go $102 million payrol 2009 $26 million 2013? I resist word ‘tanking,’ i’m pro ‘rebuilding,’ it’ necessary, said lo angel dodger presid stan kasten, former life ran hawk gener manag ‘80 ‘90s, telephon sunday. and, it’ painful, kasten said. you’v got explain team, fans, front office, coaches, wife, kids, countri club. it’ hard. it’ painful. it’ nobody’ first choice. but it’ necessary, it’ often quickest way get team back winning. and don’t lose sight that. kasten’ dodger lost world seri astros, method built team last four year around young draft player like seri mvp georg springer, last fall seven games. but angri houston way manag took franchise’ foundat stud -- compar high-spend dodger -- admir speed went worst first. I real feel did, kasten said. becaus mark walter (the ceo guggenheim partners, global firm bought dodger 2012) I, bought dodgers, look houston. becaus available. and truthfully, look were, go thing. It done. becaus track win. and frankly, I don’t think I could done fast, well, (astro owner) jim crane, (gm) jeff luhnow. becaus that, extreme, take real intestin fortitude. kasten make strong distinct team cut payrol go young wind losing, one that’ activ seek way lose games. all owner hyper-competitive, want win, kasten said. and truthfully, quickest way win, least look last three world champions, rebuild get young get prospect way. and don’t think that’ better way go, ask fan houston chicago kansa citi feel. you won’t get one fan disagre done. It quickest way win. pleas misunderstand. I hate tanking. I hate idea introduc lose shop, even indirectly. it’ like virus, extrem difficult get rid get franchise’ bloodstream. A ticket is, essence, contract parties: I pay top dollar, give top-dollar product exchange. when team tanks, violat compact; I don’t recal team that’ given fan tank discount. It also difficult tank effect nba. the last three team best odd get no. 1 draft go lotteri -- boston (2017), philadelphia (2016) minnesota (2015) -- inde won. but prior that, team best odd didn’t get first pick 10 consecut years, 22 time last 25 years. and even team buck odd get first pick often pick wrong, I miss anthoni bennett night cleveland, andrea bargnani statu outsid air canada centre? the draft often crap shoot anyway, offici second team said. so give fan best product draft donovan mitchell, utah season. the jazz trade right kia rooki year candidate, taken near bottom lotteri (13th overal denver nuggets). thi came season jazz went 51-31 first-round playoff series. I agree. tank reward excel team build -- good drafting, good free-ag signings, good player develop -- reward exact opposit that. it’ golden ticket doesn’t even requir buy everlast gobstopper. but, tank reality. you can’t pretend isn’t. and way complet get tank pro sport elimin draft sports, includ nba. We don’t want conversation, we? personally, i’d love it. can imagin fight would set interest team -- wouldn’t interested? -- certain 7-foot-1 freshman center almost certain leav school earli current play school that’ news wrong reason lately? would help lakers? the knicks? the bulls? the nba team state colleg player current plays, rather desper need anoth star pair one realli great player (whose name, must know, rhyme nevin cooker)? would help team leagu doesn’t current employ anthoni davis, joel embiid karl-anthoni town middle? most assuredly. and could control want go, much, process would must-se tv. yet, real-world implic would fascinating, i’m sure could elimin draft without loosen underpin entir pro basketbal enterpris (and, yes, one could make moral case that, go whole manifest destini thing artifici bind someon compani rather let market servic highest bidder). If draft, would player lottery-level talent go college? yes, would occasion grant hill/unicorn want go colleg better intellectu and/or embrac person growth often come four years. but, sad say, kid nba dream go colleg that’ path ultim get pro fastest. with draft, top college-ag player thu needing/w go college, you’d differ march mad now. and multi-billion enterprise, broadcast network air (includ turner sports, run nba.com) colleg reap financi delug produces, likelihood across board support new player acquisit model slight. not mention, you’d much differ salari structur nba, would rooki slot draft players. and think game’ superstar would stand idli watch cheddar help produc go door guy haven’t yet done anyth … you’d wrong. so, draft isn’t go anywhere. which mean nba must decid whether want continu shocked, shock tank go league, accept realiti much patienc middl ground leagu everi team worth $1 billion. there only, pat riley said long time ago, win misery.    longtim nba reporter, columnist naismith memori basketbal hall famer david aldridg analyst tnt. you e-mail him here, find hi archiv here andfollow twitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
