              the celtic word gordon hayward coming, they lost lot depth player like averi bradley, amir johnson kelli olynyk. are celtics, construct today, good enough overthrow cavaliers?    steve aschburner: no. i’m even sure celtic construct today good enough overthrow 2016-17 celtics. the player they’v bid adieu repres sever step backward, stride forward land hayward still determined. averi bradley particular valuable, three-way player boston. three-way? yes, tote offensive, defens chemistri contributions. and say want kelli olynyk, gave celtic combin size shoot rang miss. all gnash teeth hear come cleveland cavs’ appar difficulti narrow the final gap golden state, boston anyon els close gap east. fran blinebury: gordon hayward good player give celtic upgrad start lineup, kind boost they’d receiv end court paul george. the loss depth underestimated, especi averi bradley defend locker room presence. they’r go need jayson tatum and/or jaylen brown step big way. the bigger differ term catch cavali might loss gener manag david griffin cleveland. he’ one kept lebron jame happi nurs salari cap shrewd addit roster. still advantag cavs. scott howard-cooper: yes. I would still give cavali edg unless lebron jame recent sold time machin last season turn 28 year old, I think mani peopl talk boston extra dose motiv cleveland. the Cs win east, though, would hardli surprise. they better I know say cleveland. shaun powell: they'r probabl readi beat cav right now, bar circumst is, i'm sure primari goal. danni aing want team readi five-to six-year run particularli if/when lebron jame enough cleveland, could season. In order stay ahead washington wizards, toronto raptor whomev els becom contend east, ang must soon address big man issue. the celtic need rim protector. john schuhmann: th answer question cav celtics. It promis anoth drama-fil season cleveland, fear lebron jame leav (again) next summer kevin love remain trade rumors. If cav stay focus line build better defens habit season last year, remain favorit east. but wheel start come cleveland, celtic capabl take advantage. with improv shoot playmaking, boston could top-fiv offens first time 26 year (sinc 1990-91, last time larri bird play 50 games). I curiou see hold defens take step backward end floor last season lose bradley johnson. sekou smith: no, they'r quit yet. the loss averi bradley directli impact (theoretical) matchup cavali best possibl defend kyri irv longer green white. the loss bradley devast enough, given abil end floor fit alongsid isaiah thomas. but least tri slow kyri would game changer series. I know give someth (or someone) qualiti get someth qualiti return time year nba, bradley piec I felt valuabl part instance. ian thomsen:on paper, today, celtic don’t star power bring lebron james. but outlook may differ nine month now. jame seek eighth straight nba finals, even relev teammat tri get fourth year row. miami look like tire team reach fourth straight final 2014, kobe’ laker fell short fourth success final 2011. In threshold year, conditioning, teamwork humil could carri celtic long way. No one predict nba final appear them, one count either. lang whitaker: didn't celtic finish eastern conference' best regular-season mark 2016-17? that tend get overlook aftermath thrash cavali confer finals, celtic best team eastern confer last season, least record. olynyk moments, johnson mostli contributor floor, guy I realli like lose averi bradley. not bradley one nba' best perimet defenders, also provid import defens cover isaiah thomas, knock spot-up jumpers. the way make sens zoom look bigger picture: If lose bradley, olynyk johnson ad hayward, tatum marcu morris, I feel like mostli net-plus. especi someon els (marcu smart?) accept defens stopper role. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
