            rajon rondo stretch five straight dnp new year' eve jan. 9.
           thi sign for. but will discuss it. I haven’t much attent while, rajon rondo said, chuckling, answer question last week. He hadn’t much attent team late, either. It odd season far rondo chicago bulls, still thick playoff race nobody-gets-elimin eastern conference, far contend team coupl year ago. chicago like all-star jimmi butler, futur hall famer dwyan wade, doesn’t appear whole lot chemistry. given mix rondo, wade butler -- three talent players, ways, need ball -- that’ surprising. but figur way make work. for now, coach fred hoiberg opt separ three bring rondo bench, push tempo get ball shooter like doug mcdermott nikola mirotic, slasher like rooki denzel valentine. michael carter-williams, acquir milwauke earlier year, start sinc new year’ eve, night rondo log -20 plus-minu first half bull loss pacers. rondo say told staffer wouldn’t name team take start lineup to save myself. and rondo’ reaction? I thought (bleep), said. dig rotat issu chicago bull rajon rondo. the developments, follow five straight dnp-cd four-tim all-star, led tightest lip chicago side dr. nick’ botox emporium. rondo, nice can, say bull chang said role would chicago season got come windi citi two-year, $28 million deal. the bull saying, nice can, rondo hadn’t good decemb (the team’ defens number crater floor month) need accept backup role -- least now. I happi way kept ready, stay posit time lineup, hoiberg said last week, rondo score 12 points, grab four rebound ad six assist three steal 27 minut 101-99 road loss washington wizards. but nobodi els bull manag say much all. rondo say brief convers GM gar forman, that, there’ ton communication. but rondo could alway go somewher els season; second year deal bull isn’t fulli guaranteed. the bigger question 30-year-old rondo whether he’ still someon fit today’ nba anymore. or, someon know rondo well, like him, said weekend: he’ stubborn littl (bleep). that’ is. how chemistri issu affect chicago bull season? naturally, rondo believ still place today’ game. He still push ball, still find open men seemingli imposs angles, still pressur ball well anyon (though acknowledg coupl year ago he’ backtrack defens recent seasons). and, know now, he’ wick smart basketball. it’ just, maybe, personnel situation, rondo say response. I mean, last year -- I hate keep talk last year -- couldn’t name three peopl team, sacramento kings, I led leagu assists. you know? I don’t know. I believ (that skill set still value), given right personnel flow game. but goe forward career, even discern plays? absolutely, rondo said. I cautiou summer, I chose play. what I told meet … it’ littl differ (now) I told. that’ I say. that big me, come understand i’m guy that, I learn system, I run show. that’ I do. I don’t tri come act like I know all, that’ I put extra work watch film, get understand want personnel, player. that’ I best. I manag get three hall famer ball keep everybodi happy. all I two year (wade and, presumably, butler) I one (presumably, demarcu cousins) last year. it’ pretti simple. that’ I do. I run show. peopl know rondo believ still starter chicago, can’t current group. rajon play guy suit way plays, one person close said. if he’ shooter slashers, he’ll fine. they’ll fine. I think butler play together, mayb wade butler play together. but wade butler can’t play together. there warn sign side made leap, chose believ could make marriag work. 
    chicago bull guard rajon rondo
   the bull want point guard could play fast pace, stapl hoiberg’ belief offense. hi 2014-15 iowa state team 11th countri adjust tempo, per stat guru ken pomeroy, whose kenpom blog must-read colleg hoop advanc stat crowd. the cyclon eighth countri averag possess length (15.2 seconds) tie seventh nation adjust offens effici (118.3 point per 100 possessions), 15th score averag (77.8 point per game). with rose point, hoiberg continu want chicago play faster. the bull 21st leagu offens rate last season (102.1) 13th pace (an estim 98.25 possess per 48 minutes). By contrast, rondo’ king led nba pace (102.24) 13th offens rate (103.3), rondo led leagu assist (11.7); also shot best floor three years, includ career-best 36.5 percent 3-pointers. but king also 28th turnov (16.2 per game) last season. that wasn’t rondo’ fault, course, still red flag. butler seem chafe last season play next derrick rose; said noth personal, wasn’t lot flow two. and sinc bull given butler max deal, seem clear chicago increasingli team, even though struggl last season new responsibility. the bulls, though, still sign wade two year $47 million, sign rondo, ad two alpha male mix. A lot peopl around leagu weren’t surpris went south quickly, everyon think rondo blame. rondo never good shooter; last season king nothwithstanding, career percentag behind arc .291. He hasn’t shot 50 percent better season sinc 2009-10, first four straight all-star season boston. you argu merit constantli hunt 3-pointers, that’ way game play today, can’t make shot deep -- especi guard -- aren’t valu nearli much can. rajon rondo throw dunk wizards. for now, though, rondo’ stay calm. there repeat run-in assist coach jim boylan earli december, led one-gam suspension. hi comment media last week measured, hostile. He answer everi question everi report had, took pain say thing knew could taken context. one thing is, i’m super happi handl it, veteran forward longtim bull taj gibson said. that speak he’ grown, talk it. I miss last coupl games, I realli did. he’ great player. He facilit ball. i’m happi didn’t overdo it. he’ pro. he’ great locker room. the bull place term effort, style play consist -- though butler’ all-star level much season. mcdermott terribl slump late; score career-high 31 point road win memphi sunday. chicago three great win row right new year’s, beat charlotte, cleveland toronto. then lost oklahoma city, washington otherwis reel knicks. they’r playoff race, it. and, rondo contemplates. it’ littl different, said. I figur out, even carefully, I choos do, I choos play for. more morn tip: da' top 15 rank | nba legend get second life new 3-on-3 leagu | q&a brandon ingram longtim nba reporter, columnist naismith memori basketbal hall famer david aldridg analyst tnt. you e-mail him here, find hi archiv here and follow twitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
