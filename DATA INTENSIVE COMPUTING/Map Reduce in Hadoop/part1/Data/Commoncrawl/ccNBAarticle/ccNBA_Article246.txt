So me, I need follow draymond tri does. when he’ scoring, he’ still all star he’ everyth else. bell’ defens skill eager pass ball mani teams’ draft board last month. hi modest offens game (10.9 ppg third final year oregon)? not much. but green doubters, too, come michigan state, look now. bell look nonstop.
