At celtic practic georgetown saturday, celtic coach brad steven couldn’t singl answer. I mean, I don’t think it’ easi say one two things, said stevens. [in game 3] terrif defensively, forc turnovers, get running. they’v rebound almost fifti percent shot first quarter us. so… tremendous, they’v realli great. Of course, simpl make one adjustment, steven celtic would fix ail stop dig hole must spend next quarter climb out. steven tri shuffl starters, swap gerald green amir johnson, much effect. steven allow he’ consid make anoth chang start five game 4 sunday (6:30 pm est, tnt). with three day games, there’ lot time think, unfortunately, steven said chuckle. while boston make changes, noth chang fact washington’ start five john wall, bradley beal, otto porter, markieff morri marcin gortat play terrif basketbal together.

If get defens stop get transition, lot easier play halfcourt. obviously, put lot attent isaiah everi team play has, said stevens, but thing I saw realli hard. they play except hard, that’ deal: it’ mani guys, it’ hard guy playing. so, that’ credit them. but isaiah’ play doubl tripl stuff year, better. that’ everybodi roster, bench, coach staff, better job moments. but again, credit washington, play realli well play realli hard. much harder did. time heal many, all, wounds, play five playoff game nine days, includ three game five day washington, celtic took friday rest regroup. we need one days, said thomas, asid play basketbal made cross-countri trip seattl last week famili follow death sister, spent extens time dentist’ chair tooth knock chicago round 1. but thoma vow time dentist done—they ain’t touch mouth more.—and celtic say they’r use extra time put renew focu get good start game 4.
