It true true now. If follow money, you’ll almost alway get truth matter, matter subject. In morning’ particular case, it’ likelihood new collect bargain agreement nba nation basketbal players’ associ -- deal replac exist pact iron 2011 lockout, prevent potenti lockout next summer. both leagu union right exist agreement opt dec. 15, action would, normal year, almost sure mean work stoppag 2017. but year, third parti interven acceler negoti point new deal like agre upon, formal ratified, next weeks. hello, rich uncl pennybags! notori rup repres $24 billion televis money come nba, payment league’ network cabl partner (abc/espn turner sports, run nba.com) new televis deal run 2025. that unpreced spike fund flow throughout system last summer, forc contract like one seen, team spend least 90 percent salari cap almost doubl size past three years. So $153 million mike conley, $94 million chandler parson (both memphis), $80 million ryan anderson, $70 million evan turner, $64 million timofey mozgov ian mahinmi, on. there also $139 million demar derozan, $128 million bradley beal, $127 million andr drummond $120 million nicola batum. nba cap expert albert nahmad estim nba team commit $4.5 billion new contract summer 275 players. and money creat breath room, leagu union, made split econom pie expect rise current $4 billion $8 billion time propos cba end much easier.

(a deal yet done, side continu respect news blackout state negotiations, though detail progress side leak month ago.) there’ doubt that. it’ littl bit chicken egg, observ noted. would person different, would tone attitud different, (previous) econom climate? it’ hard say. she tough, time, also reasonable. and he, likewise. here must point negoti aren’t completed, negotiation, thing turn chang suddenli -- badly. but sens present major point content two sides, month behind-the-scen negoti involv union’ execut committee, includ nbpa presid chri paul player includ lebron james, carmelo anthoni veteran jame jone kyle korver, league’ negoti committee, includ influenti owner team execut like michael jordan (charlott hornets), jeani buss (lo angel lakers) wyc grousbeck (boston celtics). silver acknowledg last month’ board governor meet new york the fortun league, fact money distribut among player teams, creat atmospher make conduc continu deal look lot like current deal.
