I would argu recogn least earli clearli I -- mayb earlier. and becam pain obviou discuss them. It poorli kept secret leagu circl budenholz wilcox weren’t see eye eye direct team. It seem philosoph personal. but differences, hawk couldn’t seem commit direct last year half. they hesit offer horford max deal last summer becam unrestrict free agent, walk boston celtics. recal bludgeon two straight playoff bigger, athlet cleveland cavali -- consecut 4-0 sweep -- hawk quickli jump dwight howard replac horford, give three-year deal $70.5 million. but didn’t get shooter could play howard, gum one league’ effici pass-friendli offenses. they re-sign kent bazemore, who’d effect player bench 60-win season, struggl starter demarr carroll’ departur raptor 2015. two season ago, hawk sixth leagu offens rating, averag 110 point per 100 possessions. they second 3-point shoot (38 percent) assist per game (25.7), third true shoot percentag (.563) effect field goal percentag (.527). all number cratered. thi season, atlanta fell 27th leagu offens rate (104.9 point per 100), 23rd 3-point shoot (34.1 percent) 10th assist per game (23.6), drop tie 18th tsp (.541) 18th efg (.504). bare .500 christmas, atlanta look like would start rebuild full, send 35-year-old korver cleveland veteran mike dunleavi -- move would open play time fourth-year guard tim hardaway, jr., hawk believ star potenti spent year work sinc get new york knick 2016 draft night deal. they trade veteran center tiago splitter, they’d given san antonio spur second-round pick 2015, philadelphia stretch four ersan ilyasova. next veteran forward mike scott, fallen team’ rotation, phoenix second-round pick raptors’ trade p.j. tucker. the next logic move would trade millsap, becom unrestrict free agent summer if, expected, opt final year contract -- who, like horford, would seek huge payday. but hem hawing, hawk took millsap trade block, move reflect divis budenholz wilcox. sourc said wilcox want move millsap go all-in rebuild, focus team’ young talent like schroeder, hardaway rooki taurean princ deandre’ bembry. but budenholzer, final say personnel moves, approv trade teagu indiana last summer, nix potenti deals. it kind game throne kind thing, said one observ familiar parties. the new GM -- immedi specul espn center former detroit pistons’ GM joe dumar cavs’ GM david griffin -- must assess whether keep hawk intact blow thing up. it’ easi call make case either way. but decis must made. millsap’ futur first foremost.
