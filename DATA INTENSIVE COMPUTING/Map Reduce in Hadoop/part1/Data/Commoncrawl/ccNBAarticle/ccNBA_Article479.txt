            cavali GM kobi altman may tough call make feb. 8 trade deadline.
           detroit coach stan van gundi sure ill see brooklyn guard spencer dinwiddie’ last-second shot go outstretch arm andr drummond sunday afternoon, give net win pistons. the guess kobi altman close second. the net threat altman’ team, cleveland cavaliers. brooklyn well playoff chase eastern conference. but altman, cavs’ gener manager, possess brooklyn’ unprotect first-round pick 2018 draft, untap jewel trade engin last summer cleveland agre kyri irving’ trade demand. So irv went boston isaiah thomas, jae crowder, ant zizic, 2020 second-round 2018 first went cleveland. but everi brooklyn win make pick, potentially, less valuable, lessen chanc becom top pick lotteri may. and knifepoint, morning, ride cavaliers, midst worst stretch play sinc lebron james’ return 2014. saturday’ humili loss oklahoma citi -- give 148 point quicken loan arena -- display cavs’ horribl defens flaw nation audience: on-bal pressure, communication, footspeed, confidence. while there’ sign coach tyronn lue’ job current jeopardy, latest roughest rough patch -- nine loss last 12 games, two three win come orlando magic -- shook team anyth recent years. even cav without irv kevin love the 2015 finals, still thought could beat golden stae warriors. now, doubt real growing. cleveland 29th nba defens rate (109.8) 26th point allow per game (109.5). In januari alone, cav 30th defens rate (114.3), 30th second chanc point allow per game (16.3); 27th oppon 3-pointer made per game (12), 25th oppon point turnov (20.1).  blogtable:  how would fix cavs' defens issues? but altman doesn’t much time improv roster. the trade deadlin week all-star festiv begin, feb. 8 … less three week now. the young gm, got job juli former GM david griffin team agre part company, huge decis make. cleveland aggress improv roster in-season sinc jame come back. the cav got kyle korver last januari atlanta hawk mike dunleavy, Mo william 2019 first-round pick. In 2016, got chan frye orlando magic three-team deal. In 2015, got j.r. smith iman shumpert new york knick anoth three-team deal sent dion waiter oklahoma citi thunder, spent two futur first get timofey mozgov denver nuggets. the cavali made clear year don’t want don’t intend trade brooklyn pick (they 2018 first-round pick could includ deal), part idea whether jame -- opt deal enter free agenc summer -- return next season. jame hasn’t given indic he’ go do, it’ possibl may know yet. but cleveland can’t leav nothing. On hand, you’v got babe ruth roster -- mayb babe absolut prime, still capabl mashing. Do let walk you’v got chance, maybe, get bill dickey. (and, no, would noth wrong get bill dickey, hall famer -- except cost babe ruth.) the current consensu among mani execut around leagu cav owner dan gilbert altman will, ultimately, hold onto brooklyn pick. the likelihood cleveland ever get potenti top-10 pick jame era who whovil size. I think player market justifi unless lebron target someon make condit return, one execut text sunday. but could be? and els cleveland team would want? smith tail consider season. shumpert hurt. tristan thompson slow season calf injury, he’ display littl defens feroc show 2015 2016 playoffs. love terrif season, earn james’ prais like name all-star reserv coach tuesday. but deal would remov cavs’ best shoot big man roster. it’ obviou jame wouldn’t interest rental player go opt re-sign cleveland 2018-19. So unless also knew player acquir go stay cav next year, trade someon like LA clipper center deandr jordan guard lou william would gamble. desper peopl desper things, anoth execut said think cleveland may well move pick. the 29-year-old jordan expect opt last year current deal summer search big, max-lik payday. If cleveland re-sign james, would definit max, yearli stipul jame made clear run rest career. that would make re-sign jordan max deal extrem difficult, especi consid thoma also unrestrict free agent summer, also look huge deal. (complic matter further, jordan agent love korver.) jordan still play good defense, number slip season. how much due chri paul outstand defens gone, along injuri player like patrick beverley could help jordan season, fair ask. ani number must surround context, way joey nuzzl western gray’ pouch. per nba.com/stats, jordan’ individu defens rate 108.6 79th among player averag 30 minut per game, 12th among centers. last season, defens rate 103.7, 19th-highest overal third-best among centers. he’ block one shot per game season, block half fewer career-best 2.5 per game 2013-14. and, per basketball-reference.com, jordan’ defens win share drop 1.9 season, 5.8 ’13-’14. the cav also ask atlanta’ kent bazemore, accord leagu sources. bazemor lockdown wing, give effort, shoot career-best 37.6 percent season 3-pointers. bazemor $37 million come 2020 current deal, though. the chicago bull almost certainli deal nikola mirot deadline. the cav haven’t link mirotic, poor defend nonetheless score signific clip (17.3 per game, includ 44.7 percent 3-pointers). but cleveland’ bench need boost. chicago insist first-round return. the mirotic-to-the-jazz trade connect report coupl week ago still possible, utah fallen western confer four half game last playoff spot. rudi gobert’ return lineup friday could give jazz impetu take run postseason, would make utah aggress make potenti deal inclin keep current group togeth hope continu big french shot-block demon could get roll? it' get back play one unit. play team.kylekorv talk team improv → https://t.co/vzukpyr3tupic.twitter.com/1fdesvoue jame may well perturb cav didn’t use remain $4.4 million trade player except acquir korver last year, player like matthew dellavdova who’d gain respect couldn’t retained. (that also includ mozgov. he’ afterthought brooklyn, big part rotat first final season, 2014-15.) (cleveland also still $5.8 million tpe irv trade doesn’t expir august, $2.6 million tpe creat trade richard jefferson atlanta good october.) while jame like derrick rose, rose hasn’t abl get much regular season, put even pressur thoma return soon possible. yet cav could say they’v done plenti pleas jame camp -- get love minnesota 2014 andrew wiggins, give love $110 million 2015; get smith shumpert knicks; give $82 million thompson, agent james, 2015; give $57 million 2016 keep smith. they put championship-calib team around him, took team three straight final -- seventh straight final overall. get fourth straight final -- james’ eighth overal -- go take incred maneuvering, short order without much ammunition. and, perhaps, take remot away altman.    longtim nba reporter, columnist naismith memori basketbal hall famer david aldridg analyst tnt. you e-mail him here, find hi archiv here andfollow twitter. the view page necessarili reflect view nba, club turner broadcasting. copyright © 2019 nba media ventures, llc. all right reserved. privaci polici | access close caption | term use |  nba.com part turner sport digital, part turner sport & entertain digit network. now
