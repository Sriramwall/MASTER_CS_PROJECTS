                SI senior writer, unc  class 1983 I tri fool. So i’ll begin say I don’t presum known dean smith, gener report rare know subject well, student reporters, swept chanc time orbit greatness, clueless come. At least, one was. I cover north carolina basketbal the daili tar heel 1982-83 season, first smith first nation title. sam perkin peak, michael jordan ascending, freshman brad daugherti come own: the team plenty. smith’ graduat rate 95 percent. the tone coverag was, say least, complimentary. afterward, scrum writer would meet smith outsid locker room he’d stand bowel carmichael auditorium, cigarett cup one palm, sometim hold glass something. scotch supposedli drink, one ever asked. we’d like congratul whoever state, would invari begin, matter unc four 40, smith would go tough oppon said noth quotable, minut left everyon hurri imit famous nasal squawk. It sound like penguin retreat. By then, smith reput becam entwin university’s, work vigilantli keep unsullied. If there’ photograph cigarett drink hand i’v never seen it. we don’t here, he’d say abus fans, student tri distract free throw shooter. oppon found maddening. At time virginia unc’ biggest rival, then-cavali coach terri holland infam chapel hill said – smith allegedli shove virginia center marc iavaroni halftim set-to tunnel 1977 – gap smith the imag tri project. He also name dog dean, allegedli whining. what I know? nobody’ aliv idea middle-ag hypocrisi 20-year old notepad, easi wonder whether smith’ moral upright persona jibe cutthroat competitor, man thrall minor vices. sure, help integr state, campaign death penalty. but none qualiti – glibness, bombast, self-promot – TV rewards; compar flamboy like maryland’ lefti driesel jim valvano n.c. state, smith seem smaller life. He like way. My two time alon bookend season. smith met pre-season piec locker practic one afternoon, undressed, took question stand underwear. surreal, yes, I like man supposedli buttoned-up didn’t care student saw knobbi knees, soften gut. the second came season ended; I written piec question come dean dome way unc practic athletics, smith call in. Of school offici did, one didn’t say, ‘how dare you’ instead ask real questions. He want make sure, I think, hadn’t miss something. still, glimpses. with time, though, I began notic someth else. with alum legendary coaches, i’d seen enough cock eyebrow understand opinion often becom shade farther one get old school. smith’ player manag coach different. i’d bump larri brown, georg karl, doug moe, kenni smith, matt doherti five, 10, 20 year later, rever smith hadn’t waver whit.

I talk later that’ said: ‘the real type-a guys, could challenge.’ guy like myself? He said, ‘if I told run wall, you’d probabl laugh me.’ but wasn’t smith’ coach colleg day inspir player loyalty. It unend loyalti – coach forev after. when I ask daugherti explain, spoke long time. the funni thing is, would call you, daugherti said. he would call us -- me, michael, manag team. He rememb weird stuff: My grandmother’ birthday, mom’s, daughter’s. and he’d write everyon handwritten note he’d call say, ‘how doing?’ I nba he’d say, ‘how mani car bought? what kind watch wearing? still wear timex? you don’t need rolex.’ he alway realli work hard make sure understood humbl side life, work toward goals, alway mind others, tri give back community. and he’d alway say, ‘your commun you’r right now. you don’t alway give back hometown.’ just stuff like that, man: almost too-good-to-be-tru type stuff. daugherti know sounds. these scandal day chapel hill, skeptic fill air. but gap man image, never saw it. hi coach great good end, he’ll tell you, everi fine word true. frank defordform sport illustr senior writer He very, decent man. that appar beginning. the first time I cover final come 1960 bobbi lewi larri miller. that slightli remov hung effigi coupl year before.  He alway forthright beginning.
