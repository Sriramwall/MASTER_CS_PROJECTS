             As continu process becom player everyon expect be, kri dunn put basketbal trash bag last summer. then began dribble. twice past three year doctor cut open right shoulder repair it, second surgeri rob 2013-14 season providence. the ensu rehab process forc dunn, point guard, reevalu everi aspect game—even dribbling. first, dunn encourag softer ball. pound floor hard, player taught, would fatigu shoulder arm quickly. He also control dribbl better, garbag bag came in. It dull dunn’ natur feel; lost concentration, ball slip away. He becam covet all-american recruit 2012 centerpiec provid rebuild play abandon, two year frustrat injuri suggest longer option. when returned, dunn play park brake on. To move ahead, slow down. it’ frustrat first, find way get around it, dunn says. I chang game. the result dunn emerg member small group colleg guard neither scorer distributor defender—but rather time. the friar (18-8) appear destin anoth ncaa tournament appear travel face depaul wednesday, dunn’ comprehens output signific reason why. At 6'3, team’ per-gam leader rebound (5.8), assist (7.6) steal (2.8), rank second score (15.4) minut play (33.5) forward ladonta henton. he bring everyth table, henton says. and I say that, I mean everything. he’ everywher court. • more cbb: provid no. 5 seed latest bracket project As wednesday morning, dunn’ assist steal averag respect rank third fifth country. when he’ floor, half teammates’ bucket dunn deals: hi assist percentag 51.5 first nation. the redshirt sophomore’ usag rate 30.4% no. 1 team, play 79.8% avail minutes. there still glitch program (a queasi 4.2 turnov per outing, starters), dunn domin action end floor like other can. He play 54 colleg game across three seasons, fewer optim health. To coach, dunn akin second-semest freshman, still find way. peopl start know kris, provid coach Ed cooley says, but real kri dunn still hasn’t shown up. defin real kri dunn, actually, critic element process. He arriv 2012 five-star, top-20 nation prospect new london, conn., hard-charg guard imbu program new level hope. He also arriv torn labrum. He surgeri juli freshman season, delay debut late december. Of 25 game play season, cooley throw first seven eight dunn’ grasp nuanc concept colleg game horrendous, coach’ estimation. after dunn domin secret scrimmag harvard fall 2013, provid staff bubbl anticip pair prolif senior bryce cotton dunn backcourt. then, chase loos ball nov. 2 exhibit rhode island college, dunn injur shoulder again. He attempt play pain, log 106 total minut four games, opt season-end surgeri earli december. doctor told they’d seen plenti player thrive surgeri involv implant screw shoulder stitch place muscl move around. they told dunn 10% chanc re-injur shoulder. A lot bad thought run head, dunn says. I didn’t know I could play not. He would, though wouldn’t same. In mani way good necessari thing: dunn’ overal approach requir rehab, too. He need temper instinct aggression. you see derrick rose plays—i’m go call ‘kamikaze,’ play like he’ play football, cooley says. I said (dunn), need quarterback, may slide take knee. If there’ loos ball somewher game isn’t line, may let one go. perhap unsurprisingly, precis exampl aros preseason practic dunn lung one loos balls. onc cooley exhal relief, immedi upbraid star guard: you can’t anymore. you think game, dunn says, recal lesson. i’m lot smarter now. i’m play control like I use to, I first came in. i’m think game more. It piec well-thought path recovery. dunn also work move releas point shot somewhat behind head front nose; convent align help respect adjust field goal percentag 47.5 jump shots, per synergi sport data. He work former provid point guard god shammgod, return campu graduat courses, ball-handl tweaks. It shammgod’ idea, fact, wrap basketbal garbag bag, cone drill shammgod swipe incessantli ensur dunn kept dribbl low. when dunn leapt rebounds, focus reach arms—a small chang formerli one-hand approach improv ball secur protect arm shoulder. He refin techniqu there. dunn cooley call wind-up passer, wast motion tenth second send ball teammate. focus tighter, crisper deliveri made much difficult defens recov jump pass. likewis coach work dunn simpl jump-stop lane limit offens foul aggress brought earli career. nor could dunn dribbl end line end line full speed everi time; cooley told 75% fast enough, defens set, dunn throttl back 15%. all aim creat measured, effici player. for him, cooley says, less more. In areas, happen more. dunn arriv campu appreci recoveri stretch freshmen have, say none all. two shoulder procedur demand respons approach there, dunn show pre-practic massage, dip hot tub cold tub band work loosen area around rotat cuff. He also might throw medicin ball trainer build arm strength, light push-up keep shoulder blade tight. after practice, it’ anoth massage, anoth coupl round hot tub cold tub. dunn estim it’ two hour apiece, side workout, devot prevent measures. it’ tediou mature. I complain it, says, but get done. cooley, course, doesn’t ask dunn endur rebound drill physic test anymore. much guard’ practic time spent five-on-f work five-on-non walkthroughs. but coach see restrict one apply. we thought would see limit mobility, cooley says. he shown none that. If anything, I think he’ stronger. the product support diagnosis. even shoot score number aren’t pupil-dilating, dunn’ perform end floor merit consider big east player year voting. (cooley crack dunn kentucky’ willi cauley-stein lineup, I don’t know team would score.) dunn better free-throw line (he shoot 66.2 percent) better commit silli foul turnovers. still, also kink gener work repetition, get weekly. he look like best point guard leagu right now, villanova assist coach baker dunleavi says. the ball flow hand whole game that’ he’ really, realli comfortable. it’ made confident. he’ guy. • more cbb: introduc si' 2015 colleg basketbal all-star it’ dunn expect point, three year remov recruit hysteria.
