             On april 1, 2000, wisconsin michigan state face final four indianapolis. the game slow, grind physical. At halftime, spartan led, 19-17. sit seat rca dome, roy william cringed. not chairman ncaa’ men’ basketbal rule committee, also head coach kansas, whose inaugur coach, jame naismith, written game’ origin 13 rule prohibit shouldering, holding, pushing, trip strike way person opponent. william use game launch crusad change. that spring, committe issu singl point emphasi officials: clean rough stuff. and worked, littl while. the follow fall, kansa defeat ucla, 99-98, earli season game madison squar garden, william walk postgam news confer quipped, did like better 19-17? A decad half later, williams, coach north carolina, chuckl memory. I caught lot crap that, says. it unbeliev mani peopl jump said I critic two coaches. that point. I didn’t believ basketbal intend be. the thing change, ... get worse. colleg basketbal slower, grinding, physic more, well, offens long, long time. the 2014-15 season shape worst offens season modern history. through feb. 22, team averag 67.1 point per game. that lowest averag sinc 1952. the previou low span set two year ago. thi revers gain made last season, rule committe made adjust clamp physic defens make harder draw charge. thank lax enforc offici foolish decis revers block/charg modification, score declin 3.79 point per game. that steepest single-season drop record. million peopl prepar set sight colleg basketbal march madness, sport readi close-up. all season long, game win team struggl reach 50 points. halftim score 19-17 rang nightli occurrence. and mani coach use mani time outs, game becom intermin last minutes. As result, game danger turn casual fan lose ground younger set, choic ever before. I great concerns, say dan gavitt, ncaa’ vice presid men’ basketbal championships. the trend long-term unhealthy. I think peopl understand urgenc it, other think rhetor sensation it’ bad peopl make be. there enough peopl concern movement get thing done. that concern prompt ncaa announc earlier month experi 30-second shot clock (instead current 35) bigger arc basket (to make harder draw charge) postseason nit next month. that hope sign, approach still cautious, incremental. If we’r go summon requisit urgenc revers tide, start call situat is. colleg basketbal face crisis. it’ time extrem makeover.  dure 29 year head coach belmont, rick byrd establish one best profession. He taken bruin six ncaa tournaments, jan.17 claim 700th career win. yet, challeng win game feel small compar one face next spring, conven men’ basketbal rule committe chairman. I haven’t involv rule committe long enough know era like, one import meet long time, byrd says. I don’t think there’ question gradual declin offens basketbal reach point lot peopl think it’ ugly. the number tell daunt story. consider: • sinc 2000, score declin year-to-year 13 time increas twice. overal field goal percentag declin six time last eight seasons. befor that, decreas four time nine years. • thi pace slowest season sinc effici maven ken pomeroy start track tempo 2002. that season, team averag 69.6 possess per 40 minutes. thi season, averag 66.2. • accord kpisports.net, point per possess 2.9 percent last season, field goal attempt 1.36 per game per team. meanwhile, steal increas 2.7% team commit 5.1% turnov per possession. while one disput trajectori data, mani theori thing tack direction. mani theori center two myths: myth number one: the player aren’t good use be. thi argument hold one-and-don rule, colleg basketbal lose top talent. and front end, grassroot basketbal cultur young player come age blame wither skills. that, however, stand math. first all, peopl tend forget nba establish 19-year-old age minimum 2005, rule none done. So highli gift player colleg basketbal one-and-don era, fewer. second, 42 underclassmen enter 2014 nba draft. nine freshmen. that nearli enough account declin measur across 8,000 game play nearli 4,500 divis I athletes. while difficult measur skill differ eras, especi three-point line implement 1986-87, one categori make apples-to-appl comparison, that’ free throw shooting. the distanc plane backboard foul line remain constant 15 feet. If player realli worse, overal free throw percentag reflect that. guess what: It doesn’t. In 1972, score peak 77.7 point per game—thi without shot clock three-point line, mind you—team convert 68.6% attempt foul line. thi season, team make 68.9%. last year’ clip 69.6% highest sinc 1979. there noth wrong way colleg player shoot. myth number two: the refere aren’t good use be. say want zebras, least consistent. accord ncaa’ offici statistics, trace offens categori back 1948, constant number foul commit per team per game. sinc 1955, averag never drop 18.07 risen 20.6. today’ refere don’t lack competence. they lack empowerment. give set rule make thing better, enforc them. that evid last season, adjust physic play block/charg call yield biggest increas score sinc 1964. yes, free throws, account half bump. we told refere last year four thing can’t dribbler, call foul suppos call, say john adams, ncaa’ nation coordin officiating. I don’t think offici care rule are. tell us rule are, we’ll make calls. the extra whistl shock system, especi earli on, serv purpose. most everyon like reduc number charg calls, inexplic rule committe went back requir secondari defend legal guard posit time offens player air. last year, defend player began upward motion, differ full second. whi rule chang back? becaus offici said hard judge. the committe caved. the ref say it’ difficult determin exactli upward motion start guy doubl pump differ thing leav floor, byrd says. there aw lot thing expect offici see. thi lack persever manifest everi front, crippling. It take sturdi spine stick big changes. right now, sport doesn’t one.  for long time, attitud among colleg basketball’ cognoscenti game look distinct profession counterparts. that reasonable, right game distinct, nba also sport like footbal hockey. here five rule chang would push pendulum back right direction: 1. the shot clock shorten 30 seconds. some promin coaches, like syracuse’ jim boeheim villanova’ jay wright, extens intern experience, would like see clock reduc 24 seconds, case nba fiba. reduc 30 would speed game allow colleg basketbal remain distinctive. whi wouldn’t go 30? that’ better question, ask duke coach mike krzyzewski. we didn’t go 30 first place women it. peopl want different. it’ hard figur out. A shorter clock mean possessions, possess mean points. histori show case. when 45-second clock trim 35 1993-94 season, score went 73.6 point per game 75.0. those gain short-lived, support idea shorter clock helps. 2. the arc basket extend four feet. It wasn’t 2010-11 season rule committe establish secondari defend could take charg basket. At first, committe declin put arc, 2011, place three feet. that one foot shorter nba’ circle, obvious insufficient. that thing like bee bee four-lan highway. it’ joke, michigan state coach tom izzo says. that’ ncaa coach say go nba. I look as, nba play hundr game year. let’ learn them. izzo oppos charg call refus teach player take them. He believ dangerous, want hypocritical. there place play—charg call regularli nba games—but broad consensu mani collis reward defense. plus, it’ toughest call refere make. say adams, A four-foot restrict arc would help unclog area that’ offici headache. 3. the lane wider. the colleg lane 12 feet wide. the nba’ 16 feet. fiba’ use shape like trapezoid, 2010 adopt nba’ 16-foot rectangle. the colleg lane width, even increas 14 feet would improvement. A wider lane would push post player away basket, turn would forc learn shoot touch oppos back power rim. that’ player do—they adapt. A wider lane would also creat space drivers, allow player showcas athletic better. 4. the three-point line deeper. the goal isn’t make shot difficult; it’ creat space. that’ line move 2008 origin distanc 19' 9, current 20'. with wider lane, colleg line need extend again. If committe push 22' 2, fiba it, would preserv distinct nba’ distanc 23' 9. 5. there fewer time outs. In january, websit rushthecourt.net publish breakdown final 3 minutes, 37 second game indiana ohio state. the buckey mount comeback came within buzzer-b three-point send game overtime. It riveting, except last three-and-half minut took almost 32 minut real time. free throw three replay review slow action, primari reason took long two coach call combin six time outs. even coach call singl time out, guarante nine stoppag play—four media time out per half, last 2 minutes, 15 second each, plu 15-minut halftime. that’ 33 minutes, almost anoth entir game, talk team. yet, top breaks, coach also grant four 30-second time out one 60-second time out. one 30-second time out refer use-it-or-lose-it time team get call three 30-second time out second half. In words, rule actual incentiv coach call time wouldn’t otherwis take. sure, ref need speed replay reviews, reduc number time out best way shorten game. former big east commission mike tranghes complain the colleg game last two minut absolut awful. big ten commission jim delany, head competit committe studi issues, agrees. we’v got find way expedit last minutes, says. the game slow point peopl go watch diehard fan two teams.  unfortunately, men call time out one write rules. colleg basketbal coach fierc competitors. they’r lot pressure. they relinquish control. coach alway felt take time out away them, it’ like take first born, say art hyland, rule committee’ secretari editor. which bring us heart issue. the primari reason colleg basketbal face score crisi isn’t rules. It isn’t refs, isn’t players, isn’t offici coordinators, isn’t confer commissioners, isn’t televis networks. it’ coaches. consid game iowa state play oklahoma feb. 9. the score halftim 46-46. oklahoma went win, 94-83. the team combin shoot 49% field 48% three-point range. they play 73 possessions. they commit 26 foul combin shoot 20 free throws. yes, two top 25 teams, it’ like surfeit talent floor night. the websit draftexpress.com list one player either roster, oklahoma guard buddi hield, current mock nba draft, he’ project mid-second rounder. the reason game fun watch two coaches, oklahoma’ lon kruger iowa state’ fred hoiberg, let player go. It coincid men nba backgrounds. kruger coach atlanta hawk three year spent season assist new york knicks. hoiberg play 10 year leagu three differ teams. unfortunately, it’ imposs legisl offens creativity. the way spur peopl coach way creat rule forc to. alas, can’t chang rule game chang way rule get made. Or often case, way rule don’t get made. start makeup rule committee. there 12 members, three spot given divis II school anoth three divis iii schools. that’ rulebook appli three divisions. Of six seat alloc divis I, five current occupi men work mid-major level: belmont coach rick byrd (the current chair), marshal associ athlet director jeff o’malley, akron coach keith dambrot, long island univers coach jack perri fairfield coach sydney johnson. the 12th man karl hicks, deputi athlet director florida state. marin moment: just one 12 men rule committe work school power five conference. No wonder game stuck reverse. though peopl serv rule committe doubt earnest diligent, natur protect interests. A slower, rougher game benefit team lesser talent. byrd, example, say like shot clock I don’t think realli run offens 30 seconds, even though planet seem abl that. and you’r coach whose player aren’t quick tall enough prevent gazel kansa north carolina drive lane finish rim? you manipul rulebook it’ easier push driver, bump cutter, shove post player draw charge. there place upsets, course, happen underdog execut better, allow grab speedier opponents. I hear peopl complain say, well things, team better player go win, espn analyst jay bila says. and i’m thinking, realli say that? that’ like say took sprinter let run straight line, fastest guy would win. that’ whole point. the repres divis II divis iii also cost concern elit divis I school don’t have. propos chang line court met resist partli lower divis wari spend money. when first talk put arc, d-ii d-iii guy saying, ‘damn, that’ expensive.’ that hold stuff up, say notr dame coach mike brey, serv committe 2006-10 chairman final year. It make even less sens men’ women’ rule committe tradit work close consultation, even though oper differ set rules. In past, women object strongli chang men’ committe proposed, idea often tabled. It critical, then, committe restructured. the school televis everi night one say. thi think led power five confer push autonomi legisl enabl thing like pay athlet full cost attendance, idea previous nix school couldn’t afford so. it’ divis I tournament, I think divis I group make rules, delani says. other peopl follow want. however, there’ broader question need addressed. whi coach even rule committe first place? they alway go concern competit interest overal state game.  the undu influenc reflect respons annual rule survey. the committe poll five groups: commissioners, refere coordinators, referees, media, coaches. last year, survey ask whether number time out reduced, strong major group agre should—except coaches, 74% disagreed. coach also group object suggest player allow call time out. On questions, coach got way. five year ago, delani creat competit committe monitor game offer suggestions, although author impos change. the degre thing devolv made clear year ago group watch video put togeth ncaa. the video show extend segment final four game date back 1954. bilas, serv panel play 1986 final four senior duke, amaz saw. when see film old days, sadli era old days, game look much cleaner, says. we watch video 1985 final game villanova georgetown, one charge/block play. not one. peopl talk georgetown intimid people, intimid peopl block shots, steal ball dunk them, bodi post man bump cutter, grab cutter you’r disrupt time offense. the way guy play today, they’d foul first five minutes. A great deal chang sinc then, yet game fail adapt. the bodi type much differ 20 year ago, brey says. look patrick ewing’ build. look eddi pinckney’ build. they sleeker. now you’v got point guard see much bench press, you’v got person trainer nutritionists. If you’r lean frontlin guy, it’ hard survive. In recent years, task preach freedom-of-mov gospel fallen adams, ncaa’ offici czar. adam author assign offici game regular season. He does, however, huge say work round ncaa tournament, use carrot-and-stick routin prod zebra enforc rule regard contact. adams, however, announc start season retir 2015 final four. gavitt hope name successor start ncaa tournament. all eye decision. we need make one last desper run physic play hire new john adam replacement, brey says. mi hope autonomi everyth els go on, perfect storm might come togeth final get stuff passed.  when come solv intract problems, often told there’ will, there’ way. but way colleg basketball’ mess clear. the question is, peopl run sport come plan see through? plenti sport done it. over last two decades, nfl colleg footbal greatli diminish degre defend imped progress receivers, outlaw excess hit quarterbacks. that begat spread offens wide-open, pass-happy, no-huddle, high-scor game electrifi footbal fan everi fall weekend. likewise, nhl institut slew new rule follow 2004-05 work stoppage, includ clamp obstruction, elimin rule two-lin pass, instal trapezoid behind net, limit goalies’ abil play puck. the chang wide prais improv aesthet game, score flatlin due improv goaltending. As anoth effort, nhl 2013-14 season enact rule limit size goalies’ equipment. the nba offer best blueprint. befor start 2000-01 season, then-commission david stern tap jerri colangelo, gener manag phoenix suns, chair special committe assign elimin all muggings, colangelo put it. they devis prohibit hand-check tactic tip advantag far defense. there mani game got bog foul earli on, eventu coach player adapted. colangelo, chairman usa basketball’ board directors, believ colleg basketbal need go transition. basketbal ultim game fluidity, says. it took two year everyon adjust, dissip period time. you pay price, long-term that’ best interest game. those coach american colleg player team usa recent year swear kid play fiba tournaments, score points. they make shots. they’r reward beat man dribble. turn need shorter clock, space, tighter whistle. anyth increas freedom movement go increas scoring, say vcu coach shaka smart, serv assist coach usa basketball’ under-18 under-19 team last three years. the player kind figur play 24-second shot clock. We coach did, too, can’t run mani multipl sets. If realli want increas scoring, make rule advantag offens oppos unbeliev advantag defens right now. To fair, nba luxuri fulltim staff refere call game 30 teams. for mani years, peopl call ncaa adopt similar arrangement, instead current system offici independ contractor shuffl leagues. the idea dismiss expensive—it would mean provid health insurance, example—but start gain traction. mani confer alreadi agreement leagu share referees. Is imposs imagin power five confer band together, perhap along leagu like big east atlant 10, assembl perman staff? it’ alreadi happen regionally. I don’t think it’ big step make nation program, gavitt says. but take membership that. there’ word again—will. In end, biggest problem colleg basketbal face complacency. usually, take hard hit financi bottom line spur signific change, won’t happen strongest leagu lock long-term, lucr televis contracts. yet, watch game, coach game, play game, write game love game, doubt crisi real. the downward spiral might slow, inexorable. and pace chang speed dramatically, once-beauti game slowli steadili grind halt.  pleas enter email address associ account help reset password.
