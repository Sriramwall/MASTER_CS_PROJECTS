 support By the associ press for sport lean much familiar tradition, basebal seem chang unusu rapid pace. whether new technology, new strategi new rules, game could look lot differ next decad so. I think commissioner' tri stay ahead curve, what' best game. there' lot intellig peopl thought stuff there' lot peopl involved, said jim leyland, longtim manag special assist detroit tigers. i'm big believ someth place so, long, time there' change, there' go reaction. some go pro, go con. chang basebal tend happen margins. basketbal ad 3-point line shot clock, ncaa tournament game youtub 35 year ago look notic differ current product. As baseball? Go back decades, see basic battl pitcher hitter — fielder posit mostli way. now, commission rob manfred, seem almost anyth altered. major leagu basebal players' union agre recent deal includ rule chang 2020. when pitcher enter game, he'll need face least three batter stay end half-inning. the commissioner' offic agre implement pitch clock 2022 season, joint management-union committe studi effect possibl chang strike zone, height mound even distanc mound plate. then there' dh, use AL sinc 1973 — nl. we think chang game, game played, concern side continu voic relat pace activ cours game warrant discuss DH leagues, union head toni clark said. In independ atlant league, comput use ball/strik call start late april, distanc mound home plate extend 2 feet second half season. infield shift also limit leagu . the 1990 also period chang baseball. within years, sport realign divisions, ad wild card began play interleagu game regular season. I think littl bit shock everybody' system, I think obvious show work pretti good, leyland said. those type chang littl bit differ actual rule changes. indeed, wild card realli affect way game look field. more recent chang alter way sport actual played. new rule ad past year address collis catcher — infield turn doubl plays. basebal allow instant replay review call limit number visit mound. that last crackdown turn littl consequence. futur chang may contentious. the union big fan three-batt requir pitchers, idea pitch clock met resist well. pitch clock use minor leagues. toronto right-hand clay buchholz, spent time minor last year, said actual benefited. histor i'v been, game start speed up, i'll slow down, allow minor leagu ball, said. I sort brought big leagu repertoir I got call back up, realli help me. I thought less differ thing within game. So mean buchholz would like see pitch clock brought majors? no, said. the game' new look goe beyond rule changes, course. baseball' statist revolut transform strategy, technolog offer way measur performance. I look like, instead changing, evolving, said miami marlin manag don mattingly, 1985 AL mvp new york yankees. I think see shifts, (they) part inform age abl realli pretti specif models. you get 10,000-ball model project be, they'r go hit it. So I think they'r get precis inform get play guys. defens align certainli different, pitcher-batt pendulum swung direct high strikeout totals. more guy throw harder, mattingli said. it seem like everi day, everybodi 'pen come games, I care they'r come a-bal wherev they'r coming, could get mid-to-upp 90s. team increasingli cogniz idea pitcher less effect face bat order third time game. last year, tampa bay sometim use opener — reliev would start game perhap pitch inning two, face tough spot order. then anoth pitcher — mayb tradit starter — could come take over. while team strive edg push limit innovation, baseball' decision-mak continu evalu keep game entertain relevant. the result chang sport. where lead anyone' guess, leyland — time career seem repres sport' old guard — hopeful. personally, I think chang good, said. young people, today' world, want action.
